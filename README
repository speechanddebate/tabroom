	The Tabroom system began as two projects; the CAT (Computer Assisted Tab)
	by Jon Bruschke of California State University at Fullerton (CA), and
	Tabroom.com by Chris Palmer of Lexington High School (MA).

	Many new debate tabulation features, including the CAT and the integrated
	debate tabulation system, were supported by a grant from the Open Society
	Foundations. 

	It is now an ongoing supported project of the National Speech and Debate
	Association.
