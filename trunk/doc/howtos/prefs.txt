GUIDE TO PREFS ON TABROOM.COM

1. To reach the pref sheet for your school, click on the green Entry box next
to the tournament when you first log into Tabroom.  You will now see a tab
after Entries and Judges that says Prefs.  

2. All coaches with tabroom accounts can enter prefs; you can grant additional
coaches access to your program by clicking on "Settings" on your Tabroom
homepage (when you first log in; or click Homepage on the top right).  

If you would like another coach to only have access to prefs and not
registration details, click on "Full Access" next to their name once you've
added them and their account will become "Prefs Only."

3. If you have students who have tabroom accounts linked to their student
records, checking the box "Entries may enter their own prefs" under Settings
allows them to fill out and see their own pref sheets.  Link their tabroom.com
accounts to their student records by clicking the Students tab and then their
name(s).

4.  When you click on the Prefs tab, there will be two options in the right
column: Prefs and Conflicts.  Enter your conflicts first, then your prefs.

5. Your conflicts and your own school's judges will not appear on your pref
sheet.  Pref quotas will be based on the total number of judging rounds
remaining once your conflicted judging is removed.

6. You are limited in how many judges you can rate in every category except 1.
You can rate as many 1s as you like.  You can also rate extra 2s if you have
fewer 3s, 4s, etc.   Any unrated judges will be carried through as 1s.

7. You can save your pref sheet at any time.  The system will sort the judges
and move unrated judges to the top of the stack.  

8. There is no need to confirm once you're done. You can just hit save as you
go and each time you hit save the system will save your pref sheet; there is no
separate "draft mode".
