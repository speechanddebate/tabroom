Note; this is a fairly "you need to know what you're doing" install document.
I may hvae time to flesh it out into something a little more full at some
point.  But I dunno.  Not many people need to tinker with the code save for me.

Needed to install:

	Perl later than 5.8.6.  (There's a nasty bug in 5.8.5)

	Apache 2.0 or later 

	MySQL 5.x or later.  (I hypothesize it works with Postgres, never tried it though)

	In Perl:
	HTML::Mason
	Datetime
	DateTime::Span
	DateTime::Format::MySQL
	Class::DBI
	Class::DBI::AbstractSearch
	Mail::Mailer
	Crypt::PasswdMD5
	libapreq2
	mod_perl2

	Install all these things and put the tab directory somewhere in your webroot.

	Your http.conf file needs to include a stanza that looks like this:

<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName 	www.tabroom.com
    ServerAdmin webmaster@tabroom.com
    DocumentRoot /www/tab/
    ErrorLog 	/var/log/apache2/tab-error.log
    CustomLog 	/var/log/apache2/tab-access.log combined

    PerlRequire /path/to/tab/lib/handler.pl
	AddType application/tabroom .tab

    DirectoryIndex index.html index.mhtml
    AddType text/html .mhtml
    AddType text/html .mas

    <FilesMatch "\.mhtml$">
        SetHandler perl-script
        PerlHandler Tab::Mason
    </FilesMatch>
    <FilesMatch "\.mas$">
        SetHandler perl-script
        PerlHandler Tab::Mason
    </FilesMatch>
</VirtualHost>

Then edit the /path/to/tab/lib/Tab/General.pm file to set the default URL of
your site, and the location of your database.

Create a database and user/password that has full access to the database from
within mysql, and put that information into General.pm.

Then source the /path/to/tab/doc/tabschema.sql and
/path/to/tab/doc/account-create.sql scripts in mysql.  They will
populate the initial schema, create a default circuit and an admin
account.  The Admin account's email/username will be admin@tabroom.com,
and the password will be admin.

Circuit administrator's and tournament directors' documentation can be
found in /path/to/tab/howtos

Have fun!
