		<p>The tournament <% $school->tourn->name %> requires all judges in <%
		$group->name %> to use online ballots</p>

		<p>Before registering judges in <% $group->name %>, judges must have
		Tabroom logins and their logins must be linked to their judging
		record on your roster.  To check which judges are already linked, check
		your judging roster by clicking Judges from your school screen when you
		first log in.  You can return to your school screen by tapping your
		email address in the top right corner.</p>

		<p>If this judge already has a Tabroom login of their own, enter
		their email address to link them.  If they do not, they must go to Tabroom.com,
		click Sign Up and create a login before they may be registered.</p>

		<p>If you have questions, please contact the <a href="/index/tourn/index.mhtml?tourn_id=<% $group->tourn->id %>">tournament's points of contact</a></p>
