			Now you have to complete three quick steps before registering for
			tournaments.
		</p>

		<ul> 

			<li>
				You need to enter your student names into your roster.  The
				student roster is under the "Students" tab above.  You need
				only enter each student name once; you can just pick existing
				students from your roster for future tournaments.
			</li>

			<li>
				You need to enter judges into your judge roster, the same as
				your students.
			</li>

			<li>
				And finally, you must join the circuits for the tournaments you
				want to register for.
			</li>

		</ul>

		<p>
			Each of these steps is explained in greater detail as you click on
			each link.
		</p>

		<p>
			After the three steps are completed, click on the Tournaments tab
			above, and start registering for tournaments!
