			Now you have to complete three quick steps before registering for
			tournaments.  These steps are outlined in a checklist on the right
			under "Set up your new school"; each link will disappear as you
			complete them.
		</p>

		<p> The steps are:</p>

		<ol>

			<li>You need to enter your student names into your roster.  You
			enter them before registering them for tournaments so that, for
			future tournaments, you won't need to type in all the names again;
			you can just pick existing kids from your roster list</li>

			<br />

			<li>You need to enter judges into your judge roster, for much the
			same reason as the student roster.</li>
			<br />

			<li>And finally, you must join the circuits for the tournaments you
			want to register for. </li>

		</ol>

		<p>Each of these steps is explained in greater detail as you click on
		each link.</p>

		<p>After the three steps are completed, click on the Tournaments
		tab above, and start registering for tournaments!</p>
