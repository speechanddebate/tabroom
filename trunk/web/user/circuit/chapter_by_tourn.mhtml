	<h2>Match schools to chapters for "<% $tournvar->name %>"</h4>
	<strong>INSTRUCTIONS:</strong>A "school" is an entry at a tournament.  A "chapter" is the stable, persistent record in the master  tabroom database.  If there is a real, physical chapter called "Palmer U," then every time that chapter enters a tournament the 	tournament "school" entry should be linked to the Palmer U chapter.  Below is the list of schools entries for <% $tournvar->name %>; if any chapter value is 0 you should click on the name of the school and you'll be taken to a page to match that school entry to a chapter.  (Note that a physical university or secondary school can have multiple chapters, for example, Oxford can have a policy debate team and a parlimentary debate team and each can maintain a separate chapter.  You want to match the school to the chapter in your circuit.)<br><hr>
