		DESCRIPTION:  The SCHOOL records are school entries for an individual
		tournament; the should be linked to chapter records.  A tournament that
		didn't start on tabroom will not have these things linked up.  This
		allows you to search the database for chapters that match school
		entries, and create a new chapter if there isn't one.

		<li><h4><a href="chapter_by_tourn.mhtml?circuit_id=<% $circuit_id %>&tourn_id=<% $tourn_id %>">Alter a final result</a></h4></li>DESCRIPTION:  Rounds and ballots may be stored in the database, but a RESULT is final outcome that is generated on the basis of the ballot scores and permanently stored in the database (not just calculated in real time).  Examples include speaker awards, final prelim seeds, final tournament finish, etc.  To have these results automatically re-calculated, go to the directors page and click Reults->Web Publish.  To edit individual outcomes, click this link.

%			}
		
		<br><br>DESCRIPTION:  Most results are generated from the result_set table.  However, final tournament finish and the percentile calculated from that are derived for all tournaments (for honors and WUDC point purposes) and are stored in the RESULT table, not the RESULT_VALUE table.  Click this link to manually edit the final ranks and recalculate the percentiles.
		

		<li><h4>Recalculate WUDC scores</a></h4></li>DESCRIPTION:  WUDC points are calculated on the basis of final ranks and tournament weights.  This function will delete all existing WUDC points and re-calculate them based on the weight you enter in the box below.  Before this function will work you must have the final ranks set; this is done by creating the "Final Places" result (go to directors page and click Reults->Web Publish).  You can manually edit the final ranks using the function listed immediatley above.
