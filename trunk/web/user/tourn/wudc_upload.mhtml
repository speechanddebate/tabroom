	<h4>WUDC "results only" upload page</h4>

		<p>This page allows the upload of a tournament for which there are
		final rankings but no individual student entries and no round
		information.  The .xml files for upload are generated off of Colm
		Flynn's database.  If you are not named Colm Flynn, Jon Bruschke, or
		Chris Palmer, this page is probably not for you.  Otherwise, go ahead
		and identify the file below.<p>
