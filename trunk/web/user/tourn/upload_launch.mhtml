		<h2>Upload any tournament to the database</h2>

		<p>Our goal is to allow any tournament using any tabulation software to be
		able to upload results to the master tabroom databse.  This will allow your
		points to be counted toward the iHonors point system and makes your results
		searchable and sortable; you should not need to post your cumulative
		results sheets anywhere else.  Here's how:</p>
		
		<p>The CAT and tabroom support the <a href="/ndt/CATDownloads/UniversalDataStructure.rtf">Universal Data Structure (UDS)</a> format for data transfer.  Software developers are encouraged to export data in the UDS format, which will insure compatability with Tabroom.com.</p> 

		<h4>Upload from the CAT</h4>

		<p>The Computer Assisted Tabulation (CAT) application is the tabulation software native to tabroom.  It can be downloaded and used for free; it is an option on the top ribbon found on the main Tabroom.com home page.  You have 2 options:</p>

		<ol>
		
		<li>From the main CAT page, click the button that says "Upload to Web."  You're done.</li>

		<li>If you hit a snag or want to upload through the website, log in,
		navigate to the Director's page, and then select Entry:Manipulate Data and
		click the button in the right-hand column that says "Import XML."</li>
		
		</ol>

		<h4>Upload from TRPC</h4>

		<p>First you need to create the XML file; click Results:Main Results
		Printout:Print Packet results.  Click the blue button in the middle of the
		screen that says "Click here to create a Universal Data Structure file."
		There is now a file in your TRPCData folder called TourneyData.xml.</p>

		<p>If you did NOT use tabroom to take entries, click <a href="request.mhtml">here</a></p>

		<p>If you did use tabroom for tournament registration,  log in, navigate to
		the Director's page, and then select Entry:Manipulate Data and click the
		button in the right-hand column that says "Import iDebate XML."</p>
