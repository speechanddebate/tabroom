		<h4>Some things to remember...</h4>

		<ul>
	
			<li>
				Your tabroom.com login is tied to the username, usually an
				email address, you used when you first created it.  If you have
				changed your email address, try logging in with the old email.
			</li>

			<li>
				You can change your email address or password within
				tabroom.com by clicking on "Account" in the top right
				corner of the screen after you log in.
			</li>

			<li>
				Your password is case sensitive; be sure if you capitalized
				anything when you created it, you do so again.   However,
				emails are not case sensitive; upper and lower case do not
				matter.
			</li>

			<li>
				Cookies must be enabled on your browser for tabroom.com to work.
			</li>

			<li>
				If you cannot remember your password, or no longer have access
				to your original email to get a reminder, or do not remember
				your email address, please email us at <% $Tab::admin_email %>. 
			</li>
