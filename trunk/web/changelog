==CHANGES RELEASED 2.1.2014==

	- IE online ballots are here!

	- There is now a setting to give points to a whole team instead of
	  individual speakers; of particular use in PF some parts of the country.

	- Low point high ranks are now supported in IEs.

	- Printable strike cards now for elim rounds, both from the Paneling ->
	  reports screen and the panel view (where you get if you click the rooom
	  name off the pairing.)

	- You can set your own terms for "aff" and "neg" in event settings
	  depending on the event and those will carry through all displays, for use
	  with PF "pro/con" or parli "gov/opp" etc.

	- IE printable ballots have been reworked so you can choose which
	  information to display on them rather than choosing between some pre-set
	  and potentially awkward combinations.  These combinations will appear
	  both on printed ballots and online ballots.

	- Fixed a bug where sidelocked rounds in the first elim would be marked
	  incorrectly.

	- Online ballots will display event rules, speech time guides and point
	  scales just like printed ones have.

	- Online ballots comments/rfd are now on a tabbed interface instead of
	  having an awk second window for individual debater comments.

	- Judge groups under Entries now contain a report on part-time judges as
	  well

	- The financial report for the whole tournament has been cleaned up a lot
	  and not includes charges for part-time judges (sunday only, saturday
	  only).  It can also now be downloaded as  CSV spreadsheet.

	- Added a feature where you can re-generate the public bracket for display
	  in case you do something weird to your elim rounds and the bracket gets
	  horked.  Check results -> web publish and generate the type "Bracket" to
	  start with a new bracket from scratch.

	- Fixed a bug where prefs would not display in a debate and the sorting of
	  replacement judges was incorrect if there were no weights set for MJP.

	- Fixed the condition where if a judge voted in an elim and the sides were
	  swapped the pairing where results are displayed would not reflect that
	  change until all the judges were in

==CHANGES RELEASED 1.15.2014==

	- Fixed a bug where the per-round judge hiring methods would not appear on
	  the finance reports.

	- Method to admit entries off the waitlist in bulk

	- Added an option to erase current settings when importing a past
	  tournament's events and settings into the current one, if you want to
	  start fresh after going down some dark alley.
	
	- Made the pairings for MJP and especially for elim panels look nicer; it
	  will now show the totals for the panel as well as the differentials
	  between the total panels.

	- Added a setting to allow waitlisted entries to count towards judge
	  burdens under Setup -> Money

	- Added a feature to remove all of a school's entry from the waitlist at
	  once to the school screen.

	- Added a warning when you try to break an elim debate to another elim
	  debate but you've gone and Menicked up the brackets so the wrong debaters
	  will be paired against each other.  

	- Powermatcher had a bug where it hated divisions which contained a bye.
	  Fixed.

	- The sidelock calculator often screwed up sides in the 1st elim.  Now it
	  will no longer.

	- Option now available to permit only judges who have linked online
	  accounts to regsiter for a tournament if you're riding the wave of the
	  future and doing online ballots only.

	- The "notes to self" feature will display those notes when you create your
	  tournament for the following year. 

	- There's now an option to adjust judge hires without emailing coaches. 

==CHANGES RELEASED 12.28.2014==

	- Event rules, point scales and speech times will now appear on online
	  ballots.

	- You can now create a judge pool based on which judges are assigned to
	  judge a round.  Use this to easily create a list of judges who are in for
	  a round to publish without having to type it up or publish the actual
	  pairing.

	- Tournaments may ask judges for qualification histories online (TOC)

	- New option under Setup -> Money to charge fees for waitlisted entries for
	  tournaments that require pre-payment of fees before allowing entries in.

	- New button to remove all a school's waitlisted entries at once from the
	  school registration screen. 

	- Added an explanation of the pref sheets to the rating screen. 

	- Added round commitment to the pref reports. 

==CHANGES RELEASED 11.28.2014==

	- New feature under Settings -> Events -> Tabbing which will auto-post
	  results from the previous round when you pair the next debate, if you
	  always forget to do this otherwise like I do.

	- Changed the MJP judge placer to allow the user to place hired judges
	  before school/obligated judges all else being equal.

	- Changed the output of the entry report to be a bit more compact and
	  therefore useful as a posted codebreaker (Boston Debate League)

	- Added the ability to change the event/division of an entry instead of
	  having to drop and re-add the entry.

	- Changed the truncation method so that you can apply truncation variously
	  to different types of rounds (prelims, elims, finals) (CA Coast FL)

	- Added the ability to give sweepstakes points for a bye in debate. (LIFA)

	- Fixed a thing where 30s weren't advancing in tenth point entry (bug 334).

	- Made the system no longer accept entering both a win and a bye or a
	  forfeit because some overachievers seem to believe one ought to do that.

	- Fixed a formatting issue with the Team results that was driving me crazy.

	- Fixed an issue when someone gets a bunch of bye/forfeits and it wasn't
	  averaging.  Because apparently it's OK to skip four rounds and still want
	  credit these days.  Sheesh.  (Bug 335);

	- Fixed a problem with the Team Results report where the PDF wasn't
	  generating.

	- Changed the input of judge entry to interrogate the user more clearly
	  about the timeliness of existing judge notes.  This might make Menick
	  happy, but I did it anyway.

	- Changed the formatting of the judge selector and room selector in the
	  room pool and judge pool screens to show which other pools a judge/room
	  is also in.
	
	- Added the ability to print the site list of rooms, and also the list of
	  judges and the rooms in a judge or room pool.
	
	- Fixed formatting issues with the packet report, the elim reading report,
	  and the audit report.

==CHANGES RELEASED 11.04.2014==

	- The manual judge placer was not showing conflicts after the updates.
	  Fixed.

	- Added a function to the Speech round edit/manipulator to remove an entry
	  from a round altogether, such as when you break the wrong kids to finals,
	  and to add any other entry into the round from that screen at the right.

	- Fixed a few issues with the debate judge and entry cards not showing
	  records of repeat judge/entry matchups

	- Changed the coloration of the timepicker to be more obvious about the
	  difference between AM and PM hours.

	- I fixed a bug in the results display that meant instead of figuring out
	  all the byes that had happened in the division you wanted to display to
	  help calculate the results, it instead pulled records for literally every
	  bye that had ever happened in Tabroom's database ever.

	  While that did not make the results incorrect, it did make the process
	  somewhat ... slow.

	- The truncate-ranks setting formerly would only work with prelim rounds
	  but not in elims or finals.  Now it will work no matter the type of round
	  if it is set in the tiebreaker set.

	- The mass judge assigner under Paneling -> Judges is now capable of
	  assigning judges for all rounds in a round robin at once.  Warning, it is
	  not particularly intelligent about it (yet) and will not always fill in
	  all judge slots where it is possible to do so, but this beats having to
	  hit the judge button on every last round.

	- The round robin paneler now will assign sides in a more fair manner, such
	  that round robin teams should not have to debate the same side more than
	  2x in a row.

	- Several bug fixes to the automatic powermatcher have also been deployed.

	- Several bug fixes to the manual powermatcher have been deployed

	- The check sheet formatting is now not nearly as crazy as it was before.


==CHANGES RELEASED 10.30.2014==

	- You may have noticed a lot of weird performance issues and error messages
	  about not being able to connect to a database and some missing ballots.
	  All of these stemmed from being hosted on Amazon's cloud providers, which
	  did work quite well for me on a previous project, but on this one was
	  delivering abysmal performance, weird errors and was also charging the
	  NSDA more than it was clearly worth.

	  Since the tabroom dedicated server was able to handle about 8x as much
	  traffic as the amazon setup was in its "max" configuration without
	  breaking a sweat, I've moved the site back to it.  I've already noticed a
	  vast speed improvement and we're no longer getting those errors.  I hope
	  this works better for you as well.

	- Past tournaments will appear in your registrations for a week with an
	  easier link to the results reports.  You'll also be able to see online
	  ballots all on one screen and download a PDF of them with each entry on a
	  single page for easier collation and distribution.

	- Fixed the manual judge and manual room drag and drop to actually, y'know,
	  work.  The pairings at left are scrollable so you can access the pool of
	  empty rooms or unassigned judges, and you can flip between flights.

	- Added an "add student to roster" button in the entry screen under the
	  place where you swap in students, for the sake of no longer confusing the
	  living hell out of everyone, as much fun as that is.

	- Added a TRPC style Elim report where all the elims appear on a compact
	  page for printing thanks to the efforts of Cal Ellowitz.

	- Fixed an issue with the ballot entry when it is set to "live dangerously"
	  and would not save results.

	- The swap sides in a debate panel will just now swap the side without
	  having to go through a second screen.
	
	- Added the option to print schematics with linebreaks only between events
	  but not between rounds, so you can print a whole day's IE pairings on
	  single sheets but then break between categories.

	- Fixed a ballot formatting issue with maverick debaters. 

	- You can now add pools to a judge when you create the judge, rather than
	  as a 2nd step.

	- Clicking on a competitor when a round's ballot entry is done will now
	  bring you to the panel view screen instead of allowing you to move a
	  debater after the fact in both speech and debate. 

	- The Change Sides button on the panel view now immediately changes sides
	  in debate events rather than making you go through a second step. 

	- Added a report so you can see which judge groups and/or events a school
	  has entries in under Reports.

	- Fixed a really nasty bug where scores for ballots were being recorded but
	  did not have tags identifying themselves as "ballots" "ranks" or
	  "points".

	  this was an awful awful bug that I fixed with a really inelegant hack for
	  which I apologize to the karmic gods of code.

	- Under Settings -> Events -> Updates you can put in your tabroom.com
	  account login and get a text message to your account's phone when the
	  last ballot for a division is entered.

	- The room pools are now on a decently re-organized round setting screen.

	- A bug existed where a judge could get multiple rooms and/or two debates
	  in the same flight for a double flighted round.  Fixed.

	- Fixed multiple issues with pullups with the new powermatcher.

	- Added a screen called Judge Pref Report to the debate panel view so you
	  can see how Tabroom is scoring various judges for a given debate.  This
	  screen will help you in selecting weights for judge placement.

==CHANGES RELEASED 10.04.2014==

	- Fixed a couple flaws with the manual powermatcher. 

	- Fixed some oddnesses with how the manual debate entry screen worked, and
	  gave the option to not assign a judge or a room in this screen if that's
	  what you're up to. 

	- Added a "max pref" feature where you can set the maximum pref level you
	  would like to place in both in-it debates and out of contention debates.
	  The system will strive mightily at the expense of mutuality to prevent
	  prefs from going above that level once set. 

	- Fixed a bug where side locks were not being indicated properly in late
	  elims. 

	- I hate computers

	- The CSV judge export will now list time strikes in addition to everything
	  else. 

	- Email sending preferences were not allowing people to opt out of emails;
	  they now can despite my wish to secretly build a empire of spammers with
	  which to rule you all. 

	- Round renumbering could sometimes trigger an error which is now fixed.

	- There was a bug with removing staff from a tournament that has been
	  fixed. 

	- There was system instability last weekend that I've adjusted and should
	  not occur again.

	- The judge selector under panel view will now display diversity and also
	  average preference of the judge in preferenced divisions. 

	- There was a bug with speech ballots getting duplicate scores that should
	  be fixed. 

	- The file uploader would sometimes fail, sometimes not.  Now it always
	  fails like it's supposed to.  (Just kidding.  I'm checking to see if
	  anyone's reading). 


==CHANGES RELEASED 9.28.2014==

	- The javascript powermatcher manual screens was not working in
	  non-sidelocked rounds.  It has been educated.
	
	- The "Judging elsewhere" pulldown now shows correct prefs for the round
	  the judge is elsewhere judging.

	- The "Judges not used" screen shows the bracket.  Further it was not
	  always filtering out rounds a judge was constrained against, this is
	  fixed.

	- Fixed some truly bizarre style goofs with the setup screents. 

	- Fixed a bug that saves dates when you try to input times in 14 AD instead
	  of 2014.  Citizens of the Roman Empire and subjects of the Han Chinese
	  Dynasty are not permitted to use Tabroom.com.
	
	- Fixed a bug with judge days on partial judges. 

	- Added a manual room assigner drag and drop system to the pairings to go
	  along with the manual judge assigner of the same stripe.

==CHANGES RELEASED 9.8.2014==

	- Gave Menick one less reason to send potshots my way with a color design
	  change on the hired judging request screen.  Worry not, he'll find more.

	- Fixed a bug restoring the School Judge Obligation Check report on
	  register/reports. 

	- Fixed a weird bug with the display of tiered pref sheets. 

	- Fixed a bug where you could not strike judges by days all of a sudden.

	- You can now download CSVs of past pref sheets under the Results tab when
	  you first log in.

	- The manual powermatcher now uses a javascript implementation to be
	  instantly responsive and not have to reload every time you pair a debate;
	  it is much more usable now even with larger divisions.  Props to the good
	  Dr Bruschke for doing the legwork here.

	- Added a feature under Blast Emails & Texts under the Schematics where you
	  can send texts to All, only Entries and only Judges, and also send texts
	  exclusively to rounds that have not started, rounds that have not voted,
	  and rounds that have not confirmed their ballots, rather than the whole
	  debate.  (Bug #237). 

	  You can also use this feature to send a longer message to the division
	  without a pairing attached to each message. 

	- Added a Rounds Judge report (CSV file) under Results -> Reports so if you
	  have hired judges you're paying by the round you can see what they
	  actually judged.

	- Put in some fixes where the college tournaments etc would not appear on
	  the NSDA Universal Calendar

==CHANGES RELEASED 8.27.2014==

	- Little trick: if you hit control-s (command-s on a Mac) while on the
	  page, the cursor will land in the search box.

	- New skin to reflect the NSDA project involvement.  It came out pretty
	  well if I do say so myself; the header is narrower so the "meat" of the
	  page shows up better, and the page is wider to show more data on extended
	  tables etc.

	- Fixed a bug where entering a mavericks' ballots online would always
	  result in a warning about low point wins.

	- Fixed bug with file uploading for invites/bills/etc.

	- Tabroom tournaments will now be displayed on the NSDA's master website's
	  calendar; tournaments in the college only circuits (NDT/CEDA, Collegiate
	  Invitationals) will not be displayed however.

	- Moved Tabroom to a new home in the Amazon cloud, which should bring
	  better performance and reliability to the operation.

	- Substantially overhauled the status screens; check out the confirm
	  starts, view judge starts, ballot table etc features under Tabbing ->
	  Status.


==CHANGES RELEASED 7.28.2014==

	- Added a feature under Setup -> Events, on the Updates tab, where you can
	  put in a Tabroom login and get text messages (or emails if you have no
	  texts set up) once the last ballot of a division is entered either online
	  or by a tournament admin.

	- Made it so a single person can have multiple logins.  This will enable
	  your Tabroom account/password to be linked to your JOT account/password
	  and your NSDA points account/password. 

	- Fixed a bug where the elim paneler would still mark same-school debates
	  as a bye when the "allow school to debate self" option was checked.

	- You can now enter 23 speaker point when using tenths via a really
	  disgusting hack I'm not going to describe here.  Instructions are on the
	  screen.  I hope you people are happy.

	- Removed the bad awful event-based room pooling system that never really
	  worked that well and replaced it with the flexible round-based system
	  that works much better. 

	- Reworked the room pools and settings to all be in one place under the
	  Pairing menu with a tabbed interface that should be clearer. 

	- Reworked the judge pools and settings to all be in one place under the
	  Pairing menu with a tabbed interface that should be clearer.  You may
	  note a pattern here.

	- Added an option under Setup -> Money -> Entry Fees to show waitlisted
	  entries on an invoice for tournaments that require pre-payment before
	  waitlist admission.

	- Allowed the user to designate their own words for sides in debate,
	  instead of hard coding "aff" "pro" "con" to different types of debate.
	  This will help accomodate other forms of debate.  Set it on the Ballot &
	  Rules tab on event settings.

	- Added a feature with the point scales and speech times on debate ballots
	  where you can use ellipses now to right justify any text after the
	  ellipses.

	  So putting:
	  
		  NC...7min 1AR...4min
	  
	  in the box will yield:

		  NC...........8 min 1AR..........4 min
	
	  in the Speech Times guide on the printed ballot.


==CHANGES RELEASED 7.1.2014==

	(this is a long status update; if you don't care, there are indeed also new
	features and fixes on the bottom of this).

	So the bad news is I haven't done one of these in a while largely because
	with the OSF grant and therefore our connection with IDEA  ending, I had to
	go back to a day job and therefore haven't had much time to change things
	with Tabroom lately.

	The further bad news is that the continued explosive growth of Tabroom was
	rapidly becoming something I feared I could no longer keep up with.  The
	hosting for Tabroom is largely free through a cobbled together arrangement
	of favors and trades in kind, but would not permit me to grow capacity any
	further without expanding expenses considerably.  Support is also done by a
	small band of volunteers, but we don't always have time for it.  I faced
	the choice of charging directly (which would be a huge pain, and difficult
	to do with open source software), or not allowing some people who want to
	use Tabroom to do so, or paying a considerable amount of money out of
	pocket to keep it going heathily.

	Not good.  Is Tabroom doomed?  Are we going to have to go back to tabbing
	on cards!
	
	Despair not!  We found ourselves a new sponsor. 
	
	The National Speech & Debate Association (the artist formerly known the
	NFL) will soon be supporting work on Tabroom.com, in a division together
	with Joy of Tournaments.  That will mean full time programming resources
	and support for Tabroom online tabulation, together with new features such
	as automatic NSDA point entry for NSDA members from Tabroom tournaments,
	better interoperability with JOT for those who like Tabroom for some things
	and Joy for others, and eventually an integrated full platform that will
	work online, offline, and so on.  Our end goal is a best of both worlds
	unified offering.

	The NSDA is probably the best, most stable organization to take on
	something like sponsorship of Tabroom for the long term; and they are also
	the best mechanism for the community as a whole to collectively allocate
	the resources needed for Tabroom's continued growth and support.  

	I'll be honest, I've been critical of the NSDA in the past on several
	issues, and my own program even allowed its membership to lapse.  However,
	the major sticking point for me, working for a school program that
	effectively cannot travel to the NSDA National Tournament (we're still in
	school), was the lack of value provided beyond the tournament.
	
	However, they've done much to answer that criticism in the last few years,
	with some great video resources on their website, more curricular and
	professional development support, and a bunch of other things.  This new
	Solutions division, sponsoring Tabroom.com as a service to the community,
	nullifies that concern altogether.  It's exactly the type of service a
	national organization should be providing, and I'm very pleased to have a
	role in providing it.  I'm also more than a little impressed that they're
	willing to bring an obnoxious gadfly such as myself into the fold and to
	work closely with my project. 

	So if you're not an NSDA member and you like Tabroom, you should join up.
	To host a tournament on Tabroom in the future, you'll be asked to be an
	active NSDA member chapter if you're a high school.  Colleges will stay in
	the status quo for now, but may be asked to chip in a contribution towards
	our costs, and we'll keep it as reasonable as we can.  Remember, people
	gotta eat.

	I was going to have to hit you up for it anyway to keep running; this way
	you can support Tabroom, and also the various other programs and activities
	of the NSDA.  Hopefully Tabroom is only the beginning of what we can do
	together; we'll be collecting a good deal of tech talent under the same
	umbrella in this new division, so there's a lot of potential for future
	projects there. 

	So that's the brave new world!  Hopefully that means a passel of new
	features and more software maturity at the end of the summer when the
	season begins again.  For now, Palmer luvs you all!

	Tech changes --

	- Added database locks to prevent the creation of "duplicate" ballots you
	  may have occasionally noticed.

	- Sidelocked and flip debates are now distinguished and displayed on the
	  online pairings, the paper pairings, the paper ballots, the online
	  ballots and in text/email blasts.   They will only apply in side-locked
	  divisions; if you choose "no side constraints" in the settings (as is
	  appropriate for PF debate) no sidelocks will be indicated.

	- New feature you can enable under Settings -> Money -> Nuisance Fines;
	  when you remove and fine a judge, a notice will be sent to the school's
	  coaches (the people with access to their tabroom account) automatically
	  notifying them of the fine (and hopefully encouraging them to find the
	  judge and beat them silly.).

	- Fixed a bug where if you moved a speech kid from one room to another, the
	  speaker order of the "old" room would not re-adapt to fill the missing
	  slot. 

	- Fixed a CSS bug where the new release of Mozilla made every number input
	  ridiculously large.

	- The XML APIs have been adapted to also provide JSON output for those who
	  swing that way.  Simply include a "output=json" option in the URLs:

	  https://www.tabroom.com/api/current_tournaments.mhtml?timestring=2014-02-14T12:00:00&output=json
	  https://www.tabroom.com/api/tourn_published.mhtml?tourn_id=1518&event_id=20418&output=json

	  and you're get the tournament data in JSON format instead of XML. 

	  Now I apologize because this data schema is not very heirarchically
	  organized; it's all done via relational keys instead of being a true
	  native JSON hash encoding.  That's because the XML format was like that
	  from the start and these are just JSON encodings of the XML.  Defining a
	  more JSONish API would take more time than I have right now.  I may do so
	  in the future but if you adapt your stuff to this format I'll keep it
	  around as a legacy so you won't have to rework anything you do now. 

==CHANGES RELEASED 2.19.2014==

	Lots of changes have been released in the interim because I wasn't keeping
	very good track.  Some highlights that I remember:

	- For the nerds: a public XML results API is now exposed.  If you query 
	
	  https://www.tabroom.com/api/current_tournaments.mhtml

	  you will be delivered an XML file which contains tournament ID numbers
	  and their event ID numbers for currently happening tournaments.  You can
	  also feed it the argument "timestring" in the following format
	  "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS", in other words:

	  https://www.tabroom.com/api/current_tournaments.mhtml?timestring=2014-02-14T12:00:00

	  to see tournaments happening at a time other than right now.  Times must
	  be in the UTC timezone.  

	  You can parse this XML file for Event IDs and Tourn IDs, and then use
	  them to download any published rounds & published results for a public
	  tournament like so: 

	  https://www.tabroom.com/api/tourn_published.mhtml?tourn_id=1518&event_id=20418

	  Excluded from these downloads are ADA status, prefs, contact information
	  for students or judges, etc; it is only an XML representation of data
	  already published by a tournament. 

	  Hi Nerds!  Palmer wuvs you.

	- Weights are adjustable for MJP judge placement.  You can adjust whether
	  you want pairings that are highly mutual, highly preferred, or other
	  factors under Settings -> Judges -> Tabbing

	- Sometimes it happens that a judge's ranks or scores are doubled for a
	  competitor and all kinds of things go wacky as a result.  The online
	  ballot entry screens will fix this on a case by case basis, so that
	  judges are not affected.  Likewise, the entry results screens will
	  correct this if they happen so results are not affected.  The root cause
	  is the nature of a web application that many people use at once; it's
	  probably some race condition buried deep in the code but it's much easier
	  to prevent it from causing problems than fix it, and I'm lazy.

	- Judge diversity was added as a placement factor and the ability for a
	  judge to self-identify as diverse was also added to help.

	- Tabroom can now enter the pref sheets entered on Joy of Tournaments in
	  addition to importing registration data from it.  Do not add new judges
	  to the JOT pref sheet after you have imported the JOT registration data
	  into Tabroom!  Otherwise, JOT prefs will not import for those judges.

	- The speed of the pairing and the "unused judge" replacement screen was
	  considerably enhanced.

	- Boxes were added to the Settings -> Events -> Messages screen whereby you
	  can add time limits and speaker point scales to debate ballots.

	- Added a feature where you can weight/prefer less well preferred (overall)
	  judges over better & more popular judges for debates.  

	- Improved the judge history screens a bit.

	- The judge hiring exchange is now visible & manipulable on the admin side
	  of the tournament.

==CHANGES RELEASED 12.27.2013==

	- Added a feature where circuit administrators can set "training
	  information" on judge paradigms. (request by CEDA).

	- Cleaned up the judge paradigm screen a little bit; results were
	  previously being reported to the wrong rounds.

	- A more obvious warning was added to the schematic when insufficient rooms
	  were available for the pairing to work.  Rounds with no room or judge are
	  highlighted now in red as well. (Boston Debate League).

	- Made the warnings when you are about to re-pair a round that is already
	  with judges or with ballot scores REALLY FRIGGIN HARD TO MISS. (Sheryl
	  K).

	- Added a judgevar2 tiebreaker that will sample the students a judge has
	  judged, not the whole student population, in its calculations.
	  Rejiggered the judgevar tiebreaker to also work better.  (These are also
	  known as z-scores.)  (NDT).

	- Cleaned up the "swap judge" menus in the panel view screen, and added
	  information (which division/event, what their prefs are, and which
	  bracket) into the "judging elsewhere" menu.  (Palmer's OCD).

	- Added a weight score to allow the preferred placement of diversity
	  enhancing judges into rounds. (CEDA/NDT).

	- Added the ability to track which judges are diversity enhancing, and
	  allow the tournament director to specify a policy for that, and to
	  optionally allow coaches to so identify their own judging. (CEDA/NDT).

	- Numerous little speed and stability improvements

==CHANGES RELEASED 12.20.2013==

	- Added support for joint/unified login with IDEA once they activate their
	  Bakery system

	- Fixed the round robin pairing algorithm to work much better no matter how
	  many debaters you fling at it.

	- Switching a student will now also switch their code designation for non
	  numerical coded events.

	- The Panel Force Edit Results screen now shows any rfds and comments the
	  judge may have entered as well as results.

	- Implemented the Sloat Method of recoding entries randomly by school where
	  the school order is itself random for each event.

	- Added a little indicator on how many ballots are not entered to the
	  schematic

	- Added the pending ballot report to the schematic.

	- Fixed the debate packet report to better report results from prelims with
	  panels instead of single judges.

	- Added a report to print pending ballots to send runners out to find and
	  beat people who haven't submitted ballots.

	- Fixed an issue where the team position for WUDC events was not being set
	  correctly.

==CHANGES RELEASED 11.19.2013==

	- Fixed a problem with sweepstakes where limits on number of entries was
	  only respected when sweepstakes sets are stacked two-high, not deeper.

	- Added a feature where placement of ADA accessible rooms relies on a
	  separate setting, not the quality setting, since they're not always the
	  same.

	- Tweaked the down-and-out setting to aim for mutuality while caring not
	  one whit about quality.

	- Added a setting to specify what rating you want unrated judges to count
	  as when pairing mutuality and preferences.  By default the system will
	  use 1.

	- Added the ability to set the flight for entries in double flighted
	  events.  The paneler and judge assigner make this a rather low priority,
	  so if two debaters in opposite flights both get flight 2, one will be
	  nonetheless assigned to flight 1.

	- Improved the unused-judge swapper to be aware of elim round panels and to
	  display existing judges' prefs where they exist.

	- Fixed a bug where double-flighted elim round rooms were being used well
	  beyond the call of duty.  As much as we do sometimes stick four debates
	  in a room I'd like it to be the tournament director's fault, not my
	  software's.

	- Fixed a bug in the powermatcher where one part was disagreeing with
	  another about the nature of side constraints in even numbered rounds for
	  events without side constraints (PF).

	- Added the ability for judges to write RFDs and comments after submitting
	  their results when using online ballots.

	- Set the front page dates & deadlines to display in the tournament's own
	  timezone, not UTC, when the user is not logged in and thus there is no
	  user timezone available.

	- Added the ability to set a registration packet available for download for
	  when schools check in online for on-site registration. (Tallungen).

==CHANGES RELEASED 11.13.2013==

	- Added IE elims to the round reading report; it will print a code-ordered
	  list of all students in a currently unfinished elim round; so you can
	  read the list of those participating in the final round etc.

	- Added a timestamp to judge paradigms so you can see when they were last
	  edited.  This feature will not work retroactively and will only appear
	  for edits going forward.

	- Added a feature where non tab entered conflicts can not count towards a
	  preference sheet's denominator when calculating percentiles on ordinal
	  pref sheets.

	- Strikes & conflicts on the judge info screen will specify "Tab Strike"
	  where they are entered by the tab room and simply say "Strike" or
	  "Conflict" where entered by schools/registrants to enable shenanigan
	  avoidance.

	- Brackets will now publish advancers when the round without judges is
	  published, not just the round with judges. (Bug #115)

	- Fixed a bug where byes in elim rounds were awarding a win to both
	  debaters, not just the one who advanced.  It was also messing with
	  partial elim rounds.

	- Fixed a bug where coachovers in elim rounds after the first were not
	  being properly marked as bye debates.

	- "Notes to Self" thing added to Settings -> Tournament -> Notes so you can
	  keep a running log of things you'd like to remind yourself of in the
	  following year's tournament.

	- The admin-side pairing for debate rounds will now say "HALF" when results
	  have been input but the confirm button has not been pressed. 

==CHANGES RELEASED 11.8.2013==

	- Added ballot entry for Congress back into the mix.

	- Made fun of Menick a few times.

	- Added a tweak where the times of both flights are printed on schematics
	  for double flighted events.

	- Redid the sorting of judges in the pulldown for debate when using
	  per-round obligations so that judges who are past committment are sorted
	  to the bottom of the stack.

	- Added a "unused judges" screen to the bottom right where you can see the
	  idle judges listed, and what panels/rounds they can judge in together
	  with prefs and stuff if used so you can swap someone in.

	- Added a threshold setting to the event settings where you can set the
	  number of losses a debater beyond which prefs will be ignored for that
	  debater (unless it's a pullup debate) and instead judges will be used who
	  have rounds to burn. 

	- Prefs entry links will be red until the pref sheet is complete.  The
	  prefs tab will also be red until entry is complete.  The layout of the
	  prefs pages are also changed to hopefully be more clear.
	
	- Allowed the calculation of pref sheets based on individual students from
	  your school, not just your combined partnership

	- Put more information on the student pages about their upcoming
	  tournaments.

	- Added a feature where if a judge is struck against an event/division,
	  they will not appear on that division's strike/pref sheets.

	- Changed the panel based "force add judge" feature to be a searchable
	  pulldown menu to support divisions/tournaments that do not use judge
	  code.

	- Added settings under Settings -> Judges to put varying weights on either
	  mutuality or preferencing in MJP judge placement. 

	- Added a setting to forbid a judge from judging a debater again after
	  giving them a loss, even if otherwise it'd be allowed.

	- Changed the school code generator to skip I and O since they're
	  confusing.

==CHANGES RELEASED 10.28.2013==

	- Enabled support to create MJP enabled elim round debates, both double and
	  single flighted

	- Fixed a bug where uploading a TRPC xml set would result in all rounds
	  being marked as published and no results posted anymore. 

	- Fixed a bug where byes were being recorded as noshows and preventing a
	  team from advancing.

	- Fixed a bug where byes were being recorded as noshows and preventing a
	  team from advancing.
	
	- The final results report in debate events will also fill in the
	  tournament champion on the online bracket. 

	- The round robin paneler worked tragically poorly for six people pods.
	  Rather than demand that everyone have round robins with pods only in
	  powers of two, I fixed it.  Grudgingly.

	- A bug allowed debate events using initialed entry codes to get assigned
	  dupilicate codes with their teammates if they had the same initials.
	  This bug has been fixed.   Further, the user can enter their own
	  disambiguated codes if they need to for initial and name based code
	  regimes.

	- Tab staff can now copy the prefs of one team/entry onto another.

	- Fixed a flaw with the main webpage where secondary pages were being
	  displayed by default instead of the main one.

	- Made the XML download able to import time exclusions into TRPC

	- Re-instated a feature where you can import the events & settings from a
	  past tournament in an existing tournament, not just in a tournament you
	  are creating. Find it under the settings -> tournament settings screen.

	- Fixed a bug where judges in a debate judge group with multiple divisions
	  would find themselves judging in every division for several debates.
	  While this certainly eased the burden on tournaments for resources,
	  judges somehow did not appreciate the idea of judging several
	  simultaneous debates.  Whiners.

	- Fixed a bug where moving a IE entry made them speak 0th in the round.
	  Now they speak last automatically.  (Bug 79).

	- Fixed a bug where judges were not being assigned any rounds in certain
	  circumstances for a debate event using per-round obligations, thus
	  leaving around half the debates without judges.

==CHANGES RELEASED 10.10.2013==

	- Created the "reading copy" report for debate elims, where it lists out
	  the two teams, decision, and judge panel in long form. 

	- Fixed a bug where no available judges were showing up in the debate drag
	  and drop judge placer when the round was single-flighted. 

	- Fixed a bug where the "equals/plus" sign method of swapping sides off the
	  keyboard did not work in Firefox.

	- Fixed an oddness where the ballot entry screen in Firefox for Policy
	  events was all screwed up.  It has been unscrewed. 

	- Debate engine will now handle maverick entries and team swaps as follows:

		- If you delete a partner and swap in a new one halfway through, the
		  old partner will be retained with his/her scores, and both will show
		  up in the packet report.   If you want to delete the old debater
		  entirely, go to the card for the debater (from the right on the entry
		  screen, hit View/Change Results) and transfer the results to the
		  correct debater. 

		- Debaters left off the schedule, or dropped midway through the
		  tournament, will show up in the packet report.
		
		- For any debate where a partner is missing scores (maverick/ironman),
		  the speaker points and ranks for the speaker who was present will be
		  multiplied for team awards (but not speaker awards). 

		- The "noshows never clear" button now works for debate.  Set it in the
		  tiebreaker set and any debater with a forfeit will be excluded from
		  the elim break

	- The Awards Ceremony will now print for debate.  It will include anyone in
	  an elimination round, and the top 24 speakers for reading. 

	- Ballot labels now work for debate. 

==CHANGES RELEASED 10.8.2013==

	- Ballot labels are now using a different, more reliable engine.  They can
	  also be sorted various different ways.  Adjustments for margins and rows
	  are different. The output should also be faster. 

	- The judge auto-assigner will also assign rooms in single-flighted
	  divisions of debate

	- The manual panel creator can now create bye debates. 

	- The manual powermatcher now warns about unset sides, and auto-sets the
	  brackets when it is not set for the current round and previous rounds are
	  done.

	- Added a pulldown to Settings when you first log in where you may
	  designate your school level (University, High School, Middle, Elementary)
	  useful for reporting in some leagues.

	- Added a setting under Setup -> Tournament -> Settings to hold a
	  tournament via closed registration; schools cannot add themselves to such
	  tournaments but must be added to the registration by a tournament
	  administrator.  

	  Once added to the tournament, however, schools will be able to enter
	  their own entries and judges. 

	- Added reporting CSV methods for NAUDL Salesforce imports (Boston Debate
	  League)

	- Formerly a division set for a minimum of 1 student and a max of 2 would
	  not accept maverick entries; now it will do so.

	- Added a specific judge importer for the Boston Debate League.

	- Fixed it so that when no audit method is set it defaults to "twice enter"
	  to match what the screen apparently shows.

	- Made it simpler and easier to add a new school that has never been on
	  Tabroom before to your tournament.  

	- Made it so a tournament administrator can grant access to a school
	  account in cases where a school does not already have an account with
	  admin access.
	
==CHANGES RELEASED 9.26.2013==

	- Built an option for schools to upload their new students and judges via a
	  spreadsheet on their institutional roster rather than having to type them
	  all in. 

	- Enabled a function to manually upload tournament XML data from CAT or the
	  STA, rather than only exposing the TRPC interface to the end user and
	  relying on the built in CAT function to post native XML.

	- Enabled a by-round importer for the CAT or the STA. 
	
	- Added a fully manual method similar to the TRPC Enter Debate Manually
	  screen where you can choose two debaters, jduges and rooms one at a time
	  from pull down menus.  Does not yet work for double flighted rounds. 

	- the Debate manual debater mover thing allows you now to pick a different
	  debater to move directly from the screen rather than having to go back to
	  the pairing. 

	- The judge pool creator under Panel -> Judges now has links to make a new
	  judge pool, to assign the pool to rounds as desired, and to auto-populate
	  the pool with hired judges plus judges whose schools are debating in a
	  given round; so you can auto-activate all judges from schools in Quarters
	  for Semis, for example. 

	- Changed it so that hitting the Assign Rooms button on a pairing only
	  fills in unassigned rooms; it does not affect rooms already placed.  To
	  clear out all rooms, blank the rooms first, then assign again. 

==CHANGES RELEASED 9.24.2013==

	- Added the ability to de-duplicate your chapter's judges, not just the
	  students.

	- Fixed a bug where importing CAT XML data resulted in the lost of ballot
	  RFDs entered online.

	- Enhanced some search boxes (when entering people in tournaments, changing
	  rooms or judges in a round, and running school registrations) that are
	  often very large with a feature that allows you to type a few characters
	  in and select from matches.

	- If you are using online ballot entry but some judges prefer paper
	  ballots, you can now print all ballots from a debate pairing for
	  "Unlinked Accounts".  Only ballots for judges who are not linked to a
	  Tabroom account will thereby be printed.

	- Results can now be displayed and made public on a file by file basis
	  instead of event-by-event so you can publish parts of a result file
	  without publishing the whole thing.

	- Printing out judge cards for manual debate pairing would lead to
	  duplicate entries; no longer!

	- Fixed a bug whereby if you downloaded to TRPC, and then registration
	  changes happened, then you imported prefs after that, pref sheets could
	  end up corresponding to the wrong debaters.  

	- Joy of Tournaments importer.  Tabroom can import the Joy export files so
	  you can register debate events onto Joy and then run/tab your tournament
	  on Tabroom if you prefer.  Right now it imports data but not MJP
	  preferences (yet).

==CHANGES RELEASED 9.12.2013==

	- Debate Support. ("Yaaaaay!"). Tabroom can panel and tabulation a debate
	  format in its ordinary form, as it were.  Unlike IEs, which are paired en
	  masse at the start of a tournament, debate rounds should largely be
	  created and interacted with on the pairing directly; go to round one and
	  hit "Auto-pair Round" on the right to create round 1, and then do the
	  same for round 2, and then power matched rounds after the results for
	  previous rounds are all entered.
	
	  Breaks also can be conducted directly on the elimination round pairings.
	  Click on "Edit Settings" under Change and Destroy to see various round
	  options for pairing and judge placement.

	  Tabroom can (rudimentally) place judges in an MJP division, though it has
	  not been fully tested yet, and it has not been done for elimination
	  rounds yet, though the manual judge placement method can work for elim
	  rounds with preferences.

	  High-High Powermatching and Lag pairing are coming soon.  
	  
	  If something were to go wrong with pairing debate using new software, you
	  may download your tournament into the CAT to pair further and then upload
	  into Tabroom.com; or you can download into the CAT and then export that
	  XML for importation into TRPC.  The ability to directly import data into
	  TRPC is coming soon.

	- Round Robin support.  Tabroom can panel a traditional debate round robin
	  with multiple pods and one less round than the number of entries in each
	  pods. Supports side equalization and byes.  Note that when pairing a
	  round robin, pairing a single round from the schematic screen will pair
	  the ENTIRE round robin's prelims in one fell swoop.

	- Full WUDC style British Parliamentary support.  Testing and documentation
	  coming soon, but it now supports pairing prelims, powered prelims by
	  bracket, judge priority assignment using tab ratings, powerpoint
	  generation, speaker award and teams in order reporting, online balloting,
	  advancing to elimination rounds, online balloting and managmenet of elim
	  rounds, and online posting & text/email blasting.

	- Slideshows.  If you go to Paneling -> Reports, and click on a timeslot
	  and select an event next to Slideshow, Tabroom will now display an
	  auto-advancing (every 15 seconds) slideshow of a timeslot's rounds which
	  can be projected if you wish.

	  Slides will be one per round for elim rounds and 5 per round for prelims.

	- You can now create fake divisions within tournaments for testing.  A
	  tournament must be marked as "Test Tournament: Hidden" under the Setup ->
	  Tournament -> Settings menu for this to work.  First go to Setup ->
	  Events to specify division sizes and school distributions, and then go to
	  Setup -> Judges to create fake pools of judges to go with.  Then you can
	  panel as usual.  Go to the schematic and look for the red box on the
	  lower right to fake enter random ranks for an entire event.

	- Public bug listing.  I've created a listing of bugs using a software
	  system called bugzilla.  It's visible at http://bugs.tabroom.com.  Feel
	  free to browse what we're working on.  You can log into this site with
	  your Tabroom username and password, and add yourself to the CC list for a
	  bug if you'd like to be informed of updates or when a bug is fixed
	  directly.

	- Fixed a bug where the start and ending times of new tournaments were
	  being automatically set to midnight UTC no matter what you set them to be
	  in the initial request.

==CHANGES RELEASED 6.3.2013==

	- Inconsistencies with the way Master ballots would print given certain
	  combinations of settings have been ironed out.

	- Simplified a lot of the tournament wide settings into one set of screens
	  and one menu option, instead of a bunch (main, dates, access, messages,
	  housing).

	- Ballot entry screen will auto-advance if you're using partial points; so
	  if you're doing half points, a 255 or a 25. will auto-translate to a
	  25.5; while if you're doing tenth points a 52 will become a 25.2 and a 40
	  will become a 24.0.   Quarter points will transate a 42 to a 24.25 and a
	  55 to a 25.5.  This is mostly useful for debate.

	- Moved all tabulation and registration options that used to be tournament
	  wide, such as size of panels, judge restrictions, qualification
	  requirements, etc into event specific places:

		- Paneling options, elim methods, top novice, etc -> event settings
		- Back to back judges, panels, etc -> judge group settings
		- Truncation, noshows, time violations -> Tiebreaker settings.

	  Hopefully this change will better enable larger tournaments with
	  disparate divisions to create settings for their tournaments.   This
	  change is also necessary for debate paneling & tabulation support which
	  will be released by the end of the summer.
	  

==CHANGES RELEASED 5.28.2013==

	- Added a tournament wide "Dashboard" to the Tabbing -> Status main screen
	  so you can see the status of the whole tournament at any given time, with
	  each division/event in a box.  This page will auto refresh every minute.

	- Postings on the web can now be set to exclude the judging panels.

	- Disaster check would not actually check for panels short on judges; fixed

	- Registration log was strange around searching and time zones; fixed.

	- Fixed a bug where entries who were not tabbed through Tabroom would not
	  appear in the sweepstakes totals

==CHANGES RELEASED 5.21.2013==


	- Vast speed improvements to the results calculating engine and the
	  sweepstakes calculating engine.  Results display used to be a matter of
	  about 5-30 seconds depending on the size of your tournament; now it
	  should be anywhere from half a second to maybe 2-3.

	- Debate results can now be generated directly on the Web Publish screen,
	  so long as Tabroom is set up to understand the tiebreakers.  Speaker
	  awards are not enabled yet until I apply the new faster results engine to
	  them.

	- School reports now include debate results that have been uploaded into
	  Tabroom.  They also have been reformatted a little for legibility.

	- Added a method where you can download a template CSV file in excel to
	  enter sweepstakes points manually using a spreadsheet in addition to or
	  instead of the online interface.

	- Added a rankinround tiebreaker; this will calculate the rank within a
	  previous round to add to the current total.  So if you want to add the
	  ranks of a student in final together with their placement in quarters,
	  say, as a single rank; this tiebreaker will do that.

	- Section labels can now be set optionally to letters instead of numbers

	- Fixed a bug where if you used the search box in the tournament admin side
	  and there was a matching school, it would dump you to that school even if
	  there were other matching schools or entries or judges, so you couldn't
	  pick the one you wanted.

	- More NCFL stuff.

	- The Shenanigans report is restored under Register -> reports.  For now it
	  just checks for judges entered twice under different schools.  More
	  shenanigans will be added as people pull them.

==CHANGES RELEASED 5.08.2013==
	
	- Many other changes because it's been a hugely busy month and I've been
	  running tournaments like the TOC and the NDCA and so on and making lots
	  of little changes and improvements on the fly but not always being good
	  about documenting them.  I promise I'll do better.

	- Beginnings of the WUDC upload system so the world debate rankings can be
	  uploaded into the Tabroom database.

	- Many many NCFL reports and stuff.  Printable on parchment with the Pope's
	  blessing.

	- Elim brackets now appear if the tournament was uploaded from TRPC instead
	  of the CAT.  To post an elim bracket, go to Results -> Web Publish.

	- Elim breaks & Results generation for Congress.  this is not yet complete
	  and fully tested.

	- Pairing Congress support for the TOC.  I've added in a much better
	  Congress paneler that will account for school separation, state
	  separation if you have multiple states, and will permit you to seed the
	  congress prelim panels by enabling "Pair prelims based on seeding" in the
	  setup->event screen and then entering the students' preliminary seeding
	  under Entries->Events on the right. 

	  The paneler will separate same schools first, then same states, then
	  endeavor as much as possible to make each prelim chamber's seed total add
	  up to the same number without breaking the first two constraints.

	- Fixed the display of ballots in the results screens to better reflect bye
	  debates and to format better so results of debate rounds show better.

	- Fixed a bug where events would not show up on the results display if only
	  files had been uploaded instead of native internal results
	
	- Added in the ability to set arbitrary numbers of high/low drops, not just
	  one or two, for tiebreakers.  So if you really want to have quintuple
	  high-low points as a tiebreaker, go nuts.

	- Fixed the ordinal prefs screen to show win/losses and not ballot count in
	  divisions with multiple judge prelim rounds

	- Added the coach emails to the XML download for a school (CEDA/Larson)

	- Fixed a bug where paneled prelims meant the prelim results in order
	  display would show ballot count as win/loss, not actual win/loss (NDT)

	- Added features to view and report on at-large entries (TOC/Reed).

==CHANGES RELEASED 3.20.2013==

	- Added a screen under Tabulation to confirm when panels are started (for
	  runners, hall monitors, etc).
	
	- Changed invoices so that they can be combined concessions & entry fees in
	  one invoice or separated at the tournamnet director's discretion; the
	  setting is under Setup -> Money under Concessions on the right
	  (NDT/Bruschke)

	- A registering coach can also download their registrating entirely to a
	  spreadsheet (Donnelly)

	- Prefs can be exported to a CSV (spreadsheet) document now at any time.

	- NCFL registration complete.

==CHANGES RELEASED 3.8.2013==

	- More NCFL stuff. 

	- Added piece titles to the entries CSV export.

	- Fixed an inconsistency with judging burdens and events without
	  obligations.

	- Upgraded the main javascript library; this should make the drag and drop
	  features in various places (room assignments; pref sheets) work better
	  under Internet Explorer, especially more recent versions.

	- The TRPC download will yield shorter school names to better work with the
	  TRPC character limits

	- Massively overhauled the entry code setting system to be more consistent
	  and less just weird.  Added the option to assign entry codes by full
	  school name & initials instead of truncated 6 character names.  Also
	  redid parts of the TRPC upload to better deal with the TRPC character
	  limits.

	- Kentucky states uses a different semifinal snake formula; it is now an
	  option under Settings -> Rules -> Tabulation.

==CHANGES RELEASED 2.26.13==

	- You can now send email and texts to judges who are linked to tabroom
	  without a pairing if you go to Entries -> Emails and pick the judge group
	  on the right hand side.

	- Entry reports now include qualification information.

	- Added the ability to create a sweepstakes set that applies only to
	  entries whose students are all novices (Mass: Mardi Gras).

	- Added the ability to enter at-larges and qualifiers in greater numbers to
	  accomodate the TOC and other tournaments

	- Added a "display round entries" at the very bottom right of the admin's
	  schematic display, largely out of lazyness because this makes it much
	  easier to submit TOC bids.

	- Fixed an error-producing bug in the search box.

	- Adapted the XML uploader to be more forgiving of tournaments where the
	  directors can't read the friggin instructions and set up their timeslot
	  schedules properly.

	- The "allow judges from the same school on the same panel" checkbox in
	  fact would do the opposite.  I've also moved it to be a judge group
	  setting from being a tournament wide setting.

	- Neutral judging, which wasn't working before and was only settable on a
	  tournament wide basis, is now working again and settable on a per-group
	  basis.  (Neutrals are judges a school brings who can judge the school's
	  own students, allowed in some areas).

	- Events can be set to block first year outs from judging  (Maine)

==CHANGES RELEASED 2.20.13==

	- Working a lot on NCFL registration screens.

	- Support for tiered preference entry by round count instead of whole judge
	  count.

	- Support for free strikes entry by registrants, and first year out,
	  together with support for allowing first year out judges to automatically
	  be counted as free strikes, and free strikes in turn to automatically not
	  count towards a school's judging obligation.  (TOC).

	- Rolled out a function where a pairing can be paired manually, either from
	  the panel screen or the schematic directly.  Mostly useful now for IE or
	  for Congress.  Debate coming soon.

	- Killed a bug that lead randomly to slow performance and hangs if someone
	  attempted to access the site with a login session which had expired.

	- Some formatting improvements and changes.

	- Cloning a tournament will now clone sweepstakes rules.

	- Fixed a master ballot formatting issue (Kentucky)

==CHANGES RELEASED 2.7.13==

	- Concessions invoices were not appearing on the full invoice; now they do.

	- Before if you dropped or namechanged an entry with housing, the housing
	  request would land in limbo, and could not be transferred to a new entry.
	  Now, if someone with housing is namechanged, the system will ask the user
	  what they want to do with the housing request; to transfer it or delete
	  it.

	- Debate results can now be displayed under Results -> Event Display, as
	  long as tiebreakers have been set in debate.  Not all tiebreakers have
	  been perfectly tested; but win/loss, points, hi/lo points, opp wins and
	  jvar have.  jvar is calculated differently from TRPC; do not expect them
	  to match.

	- Coaches can now access student records, along with any RFDs and comments
	  entered online, via the student roster; click on Record to the left of
	  any student name.

	- Coaches for the NDT/CEDA circuit can enter debater honors to the NDT bid
	  sheets via the roster/record method as well, as can individual students
	  when they first log in if they are linked to their student record.

	- Fixed a bug that would show incorrect ballot entry status when there were
	  dropped competitors assigned to a round.

	- Added support for APDA registration seeding (Free, Half, Full, None).  It
	  must be enabled in the Event (Settings -> events -> on the left) and will
	  be visible and changeable under the entry's registrant screen.

	- Fixed some formatting.

==CHANGES RELEASED 1.23.13==

	- Fixed a thing where the CSV export would bleed for school names that had
	  a comma in them; and would not list all the students.  Both fixed.

	- Wording changes when dropping a judge to terrify Mainers less :)

	- Ordinal preferences can now be calculated based on previous pref sheets
	  by clicking on "Fill in based on past pref sheets".

	- Congress can be re-paired from the automatic pairing screen even when
	  there are existing panels using the new Wipe option; otherwise it will
	  copy existing panels from other rounds.

	- Change log is now searchable by date and by default will show you today's
	  changes only

==CHANGES RELEASED 1.13.13==

	- Paradigm-book support; an attendee can view all of a given tournament's
	  paradigms or download them into a PDF file for tourneys where there is no
	  internet access available.

	- Sweepstakes are rejiggered so you can run the report either for each
	  individual sub-category or you can see the whole combined points. So
	  places like NY state which count 3 entries from 3 separate groupings,
	  should create a sweep set for Address, Interp & Reading, put the events
	  into them, and set it to limit to 2 entries; the overall report will then
	  show the top 6 entries, 2 each from each sweep set.
	
	- School reports, the printing of which (especially printing all the
	  schools) used to take until the heat death of the universe, now are
	  considerably faster (usually take 1-2 minutes for an ordinary tournament)

	- Pairings and schematics are fixed so that tournaments in IE using names
	  instead of codes should be able to display & print schematics correctly

==CHANGES RELEASED 1.9.13==

	- You can now switch the sides of debaters from the panel view screen if
	  things should get messed up.

	- There's a bracket!  CAT enabled tournaments, when they post elim round
	  results, will also be posting an elimination round bracket which will
	  auto-populate under the Results tab, click on the division, and click
	  Bracket.

	- Fixed the XML exporter to never export a NULL value and instead replace
	  them with 0s because Windows throws a hissy fit when there are null
	  values for some reason.

	- Fixed a bug where if a free number of judges was set it was being added
	  before, not after, mandatory minimums/maximums

	- Fixed an issue where the email/text blaster did not show a debater's
	  opponent in elim rounds.

	- Repaneling an event/series of events, or dumping rounds and judges, will
	  now log a message to the Change Log visible under Entries -> Change Log
	  -> Show Tabulation Log.  That way when that sort of dopey person who you
	  know screws things up regularly but you have to keep in tab anyway
	  because otherwise s/he'll never shut up about it disavows any knowledge
	  when suddenly a final round is deleted, you can conduct a definitive
	  witch hunt instead of only strongly suspecting they're the idiot in
	  question.

	  WARNING: The idiot in question will sometimes be you.  Life is miserable
	  like that.  So I recommend you check first, THEN lodge wild accusations.

	- IE judges normally are more likely to be assigned categories that their
	  own students compete in.  However, if this means judges are judging the
	  same categories day in and day out, this feature can now be disabled by
	  going to Tournament Rules -> Paneling and checking "Random IE Judge
	  Assignments" down on the bottom.  (Rouse)

	- Fixed a formatting awfulness in the housing spreadsheet.  Again.

	- Debate event schematics can now be printed off the website by going to
	  the round and selecting Print Schematic on the right.  Works for both
	  single and double flighted events.

	- Fixed a bug that was improperly counting entries in sweepstakes
	  calculation each time they got a ballot in an elim round, not for their
	  placement in the round as a whole. (Sloat)

	- Fixed a bug where the stats on a round showing when it was email blasted
	  would show instead the current time.

	- The name of a judge hired thruogh the judge exchange now appears on the
	  schools' list of hired judges.

==CHANGES RELEASED 1.7.13==

	- Fixed a problem on the public site where a team's record would not show
	  upcoming rounds.

	- Fixed a problem on the public site where a team's running record would
	  show them debating themselves.

	- Pref Report under Entries -> Reports is now by entry; it also shows you
	  each entries ratings & number of conflicts, and clicking on the entry
	  brings you to their pref sheet.

	- Fixed a little odd one where hybrid team names were displaying twice.

	- XML importer will pull the elim seeds from the CAT XML file in
	  preparation for us being able to display a full bracket.

	- Sanitized the room pool printout

	- Fixed a bug where entering judges on the tournament admin side would not
	  save judge coach ratings.

	- Added TouchPunch support which should make the menus and drag and drop
	  functions work better on touch devices such as iPads and smartphones.  (I
	  haven't been able to extensively test this as I do not have an iPad or
	  iPhone.  It works pretty well in Android).

	- Added the ability to text or email blast by section; if you click on the
	  room or judges from a single section of speech or debate, and click over
	  on the right on "text/email blast this section", you can send a message
	  that will be accompanied by the pairing for that round to a single
	  section's debaters and judges, if you have a room move or judge change or
	  something.

	- Award ceremony printout will bear a warning when there are ballots still
	  pending entry in that event.

	- Fixed a bug where hired judges were not being given judging assignments
	  by the mass paneler.

	- Fixed a bug with online ballot entry that marked all the tags for results
	  as blank and thus, y'know, didn't work.

	- Fixed a timezone bug with standing school fees.

	- Fixed an issue with the IE snake in elims, and added another option to
	  swap/protect for schools among students with the same 1st tiebreaker
	  score in addition to the current option where students who are less than
	  2 seeds apart are swapped.

	- Fixed the school code generator to better handle "University of" style
	  school names so their short-name codes didn't always end up being
	  "UniOf".

==CHANGES RELEASED 1.2.13==

	- Added a feature where if a strike/conflict gets duplicated many many
	  times, deleting just one of them will delete all identical ones.

	- Added the ability to add coach notes or special jobs, together with ADA
	  restrictions, to tournament-entered judges as they're entered.

	- Judges entered on the tournament director's side of things will retain
	  their links to their accounts; this was not working before.

	- Fixed a bug where a entry whose account is also a judge (say a college
	  debater who is also a high school judge) would cause many repeating
	  conflicts to be entered against any judge in a tournament who does not
	  have a linked account.

	- Happy 2013


==CHANGES RELEASED 12.20.12==

	- Fixed a few bugs where the numbers of judge hire requests were not being
	  reported; instead it was reporting the number of schools requesting
	  judges.

	- There is now a "results" tab when you log into your team's tabroom
	  account.  Under it you can find past tournament rosters, full results for
	  IE students, past invoices for reference, judges, etc. 

	  Debate results & ballot access are next up in the hopper here.

	- Fixed a bug where generating results meant reporting them publicly
	  whether or not you wanted to

	- Fixed a bug where the generation of results would not obey the "All"
	  setting.

	- Spiffed up the reports for results to display better

==CHANGES RELEASED 12.15.12==

	- Added a school total entry count to the sweepstakes report

	- Fixed a bug that sometimes skipped top novices from consideration.

	- Top Novice options for showing the top novice who did not clear to elims
	  now works

	- The rounds are now reverse sorted in the event results display and will
	  automatically show you the results from the latest completed round

	- Added ballots the event result display in the results menu

	- Made it so public pairings will automatically go to the latest posted
	  round rather than making you click again to go there.

	- Restored room counts to the Entries -> Reports -> Total Counts report.

	- Fixed a bug where if a round was not assigned to a site it would give you
	  this totally random list of rooms that came from God knows where.

	- Restored support for pairing Student Congress.  Congress rounds are
	  paired for prelim support only.  It will pair rooms and repeat the same
	  pairings for each prelim session.  Congress is not yet supported for
	  tabbing or breaking to finals.

==CHANGES RELEASED 12.13.12==

	- Fixed a bug where not all double entries were showing up on the double
	  entry report.

	- IE events can now publish round by round results just like the debaters
	  can.  Results are listed by name AND code.

	- Fixed a bug where you couldn't click on a debater on their Results list
	  and see their total record.

	- Round by round results and individual prelim records for debaters using
	  the live updates feature are now also under the Results tab, not the
	  Postings tab, which in turn has been renamed to the Pairings tab.  this
	  will hopefully reduce clutter

	- The Results tab on the main website will now show past tournaments which
	  have published results or posted files.

	- Preliminary infrastructure in place to publish results on the public
	  website.  You can now publish IE results on the site and a "results" tab
	  will appear.  You can upload PDF files to post results for any event or
	  for the tournament as a whole.  You can generate results and make them
	  public on an event-by-event basis.  this is all under the Results -> Web
	  Publish tab.  
	  
	  Even for posted PDF/file results, The event that a given file falls under
	  has to be marked "Public" or else the result will not be posted.

	  Coming next will be support for publicly posting sweepstakes scores,
	  debate results, congress results, and calculating things like bids/quals.

	- Tournament public website informational pages, such as the list of events
	  and user-created pages, are now visible under the "Main" tab instead of
	  bleeding over off the page as before.

	- Added state counts to the Stats report under Reports -> totals

	- Fixed a bug where the CSV download didn't show judges needing housing

==CHANGES RELEASED 12.08.12==

	- Free strikes support.  You can designate judges under Entries -> Judges
	  at "Free Strikes" over on the right as Free Strikes.  If they are so
	  designated they will not count against quotas for Tiered Prefs or School
	  or Entry Strikes; good for judges who are tabbing or are late adds to the
	  pref sheet or something like that.

	- Awards ceremony printout will now work for events that do not break to a
	  final round (MFL), and will skip events not directly tabbed in tabroom
	  (congress or debate).

	- Students can now enter their own pref sheets, provided that they have a
	  Tabroom account linked to their student record, and the school is set to
	  allow it.  Schools can allow it under the Settings tab when they first
	  log in, and checking the box next to "Entries may enter their own prefs"

	- Students can now enter standing conflicts against judges

	- School conflicts now carry over from students

	- Fixed a formatting bug on the events listing page

==CHANGES RELEASED 12.03.12==

	  to waitlist-all

	- Fixed a mis-aligned header on the CSV download entry

	- Function under Data Manipulation where you can recode a debate event to
	  have schoolname/initial codes

	- Fixed a bug where all reports for a given tournament would not print
	  (Albert/MFL)

	- Waitlist and entry rosters will show how many confirmed entries each
	  school has now to help with the waitlist's management.

	- Fixed a bug that produced HORRENDOUS output for the codebreaker printout
	  if you were not using short numeric codes.

	- Fixed a bug that would not let you email all schools with entries still
	  marked TBA.

	- Fixed a bug that would not let you do school strikes without coach
	  ratings.

	- Fixed a bug affecting certain types of master ballot printouts

	- Account holders can enter permanent conflicts against schools.  This
	  works only for account holders who judge; entries cannot conflict
	  themselves from being judged by an entire school's roster of judges
	  (because that is very rarely what is wanted).

	- Account holders can enter permanent conflicts against other account
	  holders for personal conflicts.  This only works for judges & entries
	  that are linked to an account; entries and judges not linked to accounts
	  will not have their conflicts carry over.


==CHANGES RELEASED 11.27.12==

	- RFDs and Comments are now visible to students on their results pages for
	  tournaments from within their tabroom accounts.

	  sheets.

	  the side-agreement code is now changed to require re-entry for any judge
	  that got the sides backwards.

	- Fixed a bug that was causing new tournaments to have all the spaces
	  stripped out of their names


==CHANGES RELEASED 11.21.12==

	- Fixed the installer script to actually, y'know, work. 

	- The "Enter Ranks/Results" button on the Panel view will now allow the
	  tournament administrator to adjust ranks & results for debate, not just
	  speech.  This method contains no double checks or auditing, so is
	  intended for spot-entry corrections only; not for bulk entry (yet), which
	  will be available under Tabulation -> Enter Ballots once it's ready.

	- Panel view will now correctly show sides of debaters where before it only
	  showed information about IE competitors

	- Users can now edit the flight of a flighted debate round by clicking on
	  the room or judge and using the pull down on the right hand side above
	  the room selector.

	- Allowed a judge home screen to display published rounds and past results
	  when not using the online balloting system.

	- Fixed a bug where tournament uploads with a single single-flighted round
	  would single flight all the rounds.

	  student assignment cards for a tournament

	- Added a report to the final reporting which will calculate and download a
	  CSV of a debate division's NDCA qualifying points. (Me. Yes, Me.)

	- Added a feature that allows judges to enter into two groups; you can
	  permit judges in one pool to count for another (for say a swing
	  tournament where one pool is Friday and the other Saturday). (Diablo
	  Valley)

	- Fixed an error where advancing into an elimination round in IE would not
	  permit you to advance into a round where there were no pre-set panels,
	  thus creating duplicate elim rounds etc.  (Maine, Jersey).

	- A circuit can now download its contact database into an Excel sheet on
	  the circuit management page off the homepage. (Mass)

	- Explained the event entry deadline a little better. (Everyone and their
	  uncle).

	- Added a "roundrobin" type for the Event Type.  Mostly useful for the CAT.

	- Added a "level" setting to the events; this is mostly going to be useful
	  for calculation of NDT points and won't be useful for others.

	- Adjust Labels now show reasonable defaults so if you change them and
	  break them you know how to put them back.  Amanda.

==CHANGES RELEASED 11.13.12==

	- the tournaments in the "open for registration" homepage were showing up
	  in no particular order.  Now they're by date.

	- Fixed a bug where some judges were not showing up in the paradigm
	  listing.

	  be waitlisted even if the event was not at the cap.
	
	- Added a field to report on the judge's experience in the CSV download for
	  a judge roster.

	- Fixed a bug where hitting the back button after paneling the judges en
	  masse for a group would re-panel them.  Mayhem ensued in Maine.

	- The "Break Event" links on the ballot entry screen were broke.  Fixed
	  'em.

	- Printable listing of schools entered in a given division ( Entries ->
	  Events -> List Schools By Event on the right).

	- Report which tracks which schools are not checked in by event (Entries ->
	  Reports -> onsite status)

	- Restored judge, student and entry dance cards (Vaughan).
	
	- Restored the paper ballot table checkin report (Vaughan).

	- Fixed an issue that was causing college tournametns to pair speech events
	  in a Highly Weird Manner. (Diablo Valley)

	- Tweaked the pairings menu to sort by event type and then event name.

==CHANGES RELEASED 11.8.12==

	- Added a tweak where schools with judges but no entries would still
	  download in the XML download system.

	- School administrators can de-duplicate student records by clicking on
	  De-duplicate on the right hand side of the Students tab for their team.

	- Students with accounts linked to their student record can now see their
	  upcoming rounds and results for the current tournament, as well as being
	  able to go backwards and see past tournaments, right from their tabroom
	  homepage.

	- Improved results display for debate on the public site; each panel is
	  grouped and esp for elims this should be much less confusing.  It is
	  however a bit slower as a result.

	- School roster of entries defaults to a full listing again

	- Master ballots were not printing double entry asterisks; fixed. 

	- Master ballots were printing weird characters with the ballot messages;
	  this is now fixed

	  delete all entries from your tournament marked as TBA entries.

	- Fixed a bug where coach admins added by a site administrator were
	  prefs-only

	  rate extra 2s, fewer 4s means extra 3s, etc) if the tournament setting
	  for it is enabled under Setup->Judges->Ratings.

==CHANGES RELEASED 10.31.12==
	
	Happy Halloween!

	- CAT API adapted to add minimum points, and to put placeholders in place
	  of null values because .NET throws a fit with nulls for some reason.

	- Unbalanced round tabs looked unselected; now they do not.

	- Fixed an issue where a multi-judge prelim panel would not show up for all
	  but one judge on the judge master chart. 

	- Put in a warning when there are no active tiebreakers to set some instead
	  of kicking an error message

	- Restored the "visual-audit" and "no-audit" ballot entry methods.

	- Removed fines that were copying across badly.

	- TRPC XML uploads would clobber student names; fixed;

	- Error message notifier would not allow you to click on search box when it
	  was visible; fixed

	  screen.

	- Top Novices & Honorable Mentions are restored and will show on the awards
	  ceremony report for IE events.

	  access.

	- Put in filtering for the tournament name and entry to prevent a potential
	  cross site scripting attack

==CHANGES RELEASED 10.25.12==

	- Hi/Lo calculations on British Parliamentary are corrected

	- WUDC ballot entry alphabetized on the right

	- Judges were being assigned duplicate judge codes within a tournament;
	  this was preventing the next-judge function from working.  Fixed. (Sloat)

	- Changing the entry's name was leading to extra space and weird
	  ampersands.  Fixed.

	- Changed About to Help/About on the front page 

	- Congress bill packets were not posting; fixed now. (Deveau)

	  (Reed)

	  now only warns that bloodshed may ensue, but permits it.

	- Tabroom can now display WUDC/British Parliamentary results and take in
	  ballot input.
