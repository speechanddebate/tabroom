				<h4>Fee explanation</h4>

				<p class="smaller">
					"Per hire" charges for each approved hired judge request by
					the judge.  Each accepted hire request charges this much
					and count as a full judge towards a school's obligation.
				</p>

				<p class="smaller">
					"Per uncovered entry" charges for each entry covered by an
					approved hire request ; schools can hire out "partial
					judges" rather than having to buy a whole judge to cover
					less than an entire judge's worth of entries.  
				</p>
					
				<p class="smaller">
					"Per missing judge" charges a flat fee for every judge the
					school is missing.  This will be charged automatically.
					Approved hire requests will not to be counted towards this
					fee.  
				</p>
				
				<h4>Hired Judging Numbers</h4> 

				<p class="smaller">
					If you set these values to the number of judges you are
					hiring, tabroom.com will automatically accept judge hire
					requests until that amount of judging is sold.  Set to 0 if
					you want to manually approve all judge hire requests.
