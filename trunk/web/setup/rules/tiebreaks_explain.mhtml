		<h2>Everything you ever wanted to know about tiebreakers, but were afraid to ask</h2> 

		<h4>Entering tiebreakers:</h4>

		<p>You should set up sets of tiebreakers as they apply to an event or
		set of events in your tournament.  Tiebreakers work on tiers; a tier is
		calculated with all the tiebreakers in that tier and added together.
		You can also multiply a given tiebreaker with in a tier to weight it
		heavier.  So if you want your speech tournament final rankings to count
		the ranks in the final round twice, with the ranks in the other elim
		rounds once, you would set up a tier with ranks for finals with a
		multiplier of 2, and then put a tiebreaker of ranks for elim rounds
		with a multiplier of 1 into the same tier. </p>

		<p>You can set a given tiebreaker to drop the best, worst, or high/low
		values of a given rank.  Next to Drop fill in the type of drop, and in
		the number box, enter how many values deep you want to go (so to drop
		the 2 worst and 2 best speaker points, you'd put 2 in the input box and
		select High/Low in the drop-down)</p>

			<tr <% ($switch++ % 2) ? "class=\"oddrow\"" : "class=\"evenrow\"" %>>

				<th> 
					Win/loss
				</th>
				
				<td>
					Win/loss record in debate.  If multiple judge prelim panels are used, 
					this will reflect who won the debate, not the ballot count (see below).
				</td> 
			
			</tr>


			<tr <% ($switch++ % 2) ? "class=\"oddrow\"" : "class=\"evenrow\"" %>>

				<th> 
					Ranks
				</th>
				
				<td>
					Cumulative total of ranks, either in speech or debate.  
				</td> 
			
			</tr>

			<tr <% ($switch++ % 2) ? "class=\"oddrow\"" : "class=\"evenrow\"" %>> 
			
				<th>
					Reciprocals
				</th>
				
				<td>
					IE: Reciprocal ranks.  This is the sum of the reciprocal of
					each rank.  This is functionally the same as "Number of 1s,
					Number of 2" tiebreakers.  
				</td>

			</tr>

			<tr <% ($switch++ % 2) ? "class=\"oddrow\"" : "class=\"evenrow\"" %>>
			
				<th>
					Judgepref
				</th>
				
				<td>
					IE: Judges' preference within a round.  This is when you want
					to see how many judges on a panel in an elimination or
					final round preferred which competitor.  This <b>only</b>
					works at the last round of its type (it will not go back to
					earlier eliminations, just check the last one, and only
					works in rounds with panels of judges, not a single judge.
					It will not calculate except for pairs of competitors who
					have the same scores in other tiebreakers, and it will not
					calculate if there are three tied kids.
				</td>
			</tr>

			<tr <% ($switch++ % 2) ? "class=\"oddrow\"" : "class=\"evenrow\"" %>> 
				
				<th>
					Roundrank
				</th> 
					
				<td> 
				
					This determines the competitor's ranking within the last
					round; based on the tiebreakers you set.  What it does is
					allow the other tiebreakers to run first, and then
					afterwards updates this tiebreaker to reflect the student's
					rank within this round.  Set this tiebreaker *first* in
					Elims if you are running a sudden death tournament, and
					want the students to break in even numbers from each
					elimination round. 

					<br><br>
					
					This tiebreaker also then updates the ballots for the kid
					to show their rank in the round so that it can be used in
					future tiebreakers using the Rankinround tiebreaker (per
					NCFL finals).
						
				</td>

			</tr> 

			<tr <% ($switch++ % 2) ? "class=\"oddrow\"" : "class=\"evenrow\"" %>> 
				
				<th>
					Chair Ranks
				</th> 
					
				<td> 
					This tiebreaker totals the ranks from the chair judge(s)
					only.  Mostly useful in Congress when you want to count the
					Parliamentarian's ballot as a tiebreaker.
				</td> 

			</tr>
				
			<tr <% ($switch++ % 2) ? "class=\"oddrow\"" : "class=\"evenrow\"" %>>
				
				<th>
					Panelletter
				</th>
				
				<td>

					This is primarily intended for the NCFL.  This will use
					which panel the student was in during the last round as a
					tiebreaker.  This is not intended to actually differentiate
					between students in who advances, but instead set up the
					proper brackets and seeding who is in the next elimination
					round 
					
				</td>

			</tr> 
			
			<tr <% ($switch++ % 2) ? "class=\"oddrow\"" : "class=\"evenrow\"" %>> 
				
				<th>
					Rankinround
				</th> 
					
				<td>

					Uses a student's rank within former prelim rounds as a
					tiebreaker for this elimination round.  In other words, if
					a student gets ranks of 1,1,2 in finals, and was the 3rd
					place student in their semifinal round with ranks of 1,2,5,
					this would add a "3" to their final ranking.  You must have
					run the roundrank tiebreaker in previous rounds for this to
					work.  If you want to use this tiebreaker and NOT use the
					roundrank tiebreaker in previous rounds, simply put the
					roundrank tiebreaker in previous rounds, and list it last.  
						
				</td>

			</tr> 
				
			<tr <% ($switch++ % 2) ? "class=\"oddrow\"" : "class=\"evenrow\"" %>>
				
				<th>
					Points
				</th> 
					
				<td> 

					Quality points or rating points.  This tiebreaker must be
					enabled before the ballot entry interface will allow you to
					enter quality points.

				</td>

			</tr>

			<tr <% ($switch++ % 2) ? "class=\"oddrow\"" : "class=\"evenrow\"" %>>

				<th> 
					Ballots
				</th>
				
				<td>
					For use in situations where multi-judge panels are used in 
					debate; this will be the count of ballots (not rounds) won.
				</td> 
			
			</tr>

			<tr <% ($switch++ % 2) ? "class=\"oddrow\"" : "class=\"evenrow\"" %>>
				
				<th>
					Competition
				</th>

				<td>
					Quality of entryetition.  This calculates the average ranks
					of all the students that a tied student has entryeted
					against.
				</td>

			</tr>

			<tr <% ($switch++ % 2) ? "class=\"oddrow\"" : "class=\"evenrow\"" %>>
				
				<th>
					Coinflip
				</th> 
					
				<td>
					
					Exactly what it says: a random figure is calculated based
					on static values involving the student's name, their code,
					the phase of the moon (I'm not kidding) and suchforth.  The
					result will be arbitrary and random, but will not vary from
					time to time as you use it, making it a random but stable
					last resort tiebreaker.<br><br>

					But I suggest, in the event of a perfect tie, just break
					both kids and be done with it, you scrooge.
