		<h4>Create Fake Entries for Testing</h4>

		<p>
			Use the below to create a fake tournament division with fake
			schools and entries if you want to test and practice with
			Tabroom.com before running a real tournament. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Using this screen will delete any existing entries in this event.
			It will not create fake judges; be sure do that under the Setup->
			Judge screen.
		</p>

		<p>
			Create a few "large schools" if you have unbalanced fields you want
			to test for; tournaments were many/most of the entries come from one
			or two very large programs.
