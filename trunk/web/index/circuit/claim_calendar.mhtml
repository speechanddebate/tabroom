<h2>Events that allow students to claim entries</h2>
INSTRUCTIONS:  We sometimes receive results that have team scores but that do not indicate which competitors were on which team.  Below is a list of events where competitors are encouraged to link their account to exiting entries.  This will, among other things, allow the results to count for iDebate Honors points and assist us in evaluating how many students participate in debate.Identify the tournament you competed at below and click the name of the event; on the next page, simply click the green button next to the name of the team you competed on.<br><br>
