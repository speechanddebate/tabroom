	<h2>iDebate Honors Points</h2>
	<h4>Eligibility and purpose</h4>
	The purpose of the iDebate Honors system is to document student participation, and to reward, acknowledge, and validate competitive success.  The honors points allow students to earn badges and build an electronic portfolio that documents the number of tournaments they have attended, the number of rounds they have competed in, and the awards they have won.<br><br>
	Every competitor entered in any tournament that has submitted results to Tabroom.com is eligible for honors points.<br><br>
	Points are automatically calculated for every competitve result included in the Tabroom.com database; there are no forms to fill out or reports to submit.  Any tournament can submit their results to Tabroom.com, which maintains the only searchable database of tournament results in the world.  You can click here for more information about <a href="/user/tourn/upload_launch.mhtml">how to submit tournament results</a>.  If you have competed at a tournament and would like the results to count for honors points, simply encourage the director to submit the results using this link and we'll do the rest.<br><br>
	For points to be accurately linked back to individual competitors, users must have an active iDebate account.  Accounts can be created in under 2 minutes by clicking on the login/registration button in the top-right of any Tabroom.com page.  This requirement is solely due to the need for a central identifier in order to award points to the correct person.  You will not be marketed to or tracked in any way; the account simply allows us to pull all of your tournament results into a single place.<br><br> 
	<h4>Basic Formula</h4>
	iDebate Honors points are based on a percentile finish at a tournament, and are thus awarded for any competitive speaking or debating competition of any sort.  All events are treated equally.<br><br>
	Points are weighted based on the size of the tournament, so competitors who fare better at larger tournaments are rewarded accordingly; weights are decimal values ranging between 0 and 1.<br><br>
	The maximum number of points for any given tournament is therefore 100.<br><br>
	There is no limit on the number of tournaments, so competitors are rewarded for frequent participation.<br><br>
	<h4>Specific Calculation</h4>
	iDebate Honors points are calculated based on a percentile finish at a tournament and the weight of that tournament.<br><br>
	The final finish is provided by the tournament director based on whatever set of tiebreakers a tournament used; all teams are ranked in order from first to last.<br><br>
	The percentile calculation is simply the finish divided by the number of entries at the tournament, for example, a team that finished 5th in a field of 88 gets a percentile of 94.3% (technically, 1 minus final rank divided by number of entries).<br><br>
	The tournament weight is the number of entries divided by 300 capped at 1.0.  Thus, all tournaments with 300 or more entries have a weight of 1.0, and a tournament with 150 entires has a weight of .5.<br><br>
	<h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
	If you have competed at a tournament and the results do appear in the Tabroom.com results section but you are not receiving credit for the points, this is probably because your Tabroom.com account has not been linked to a student record, or because the results we received were not originated on Tabroom.com and include no student records.  Simple self-service can fix both problems.<br><br>
	To link your account to a student (competitor) record, log in to your account and find the section in the right-hand toolbar that reads"Your Account."  Click the link that says "link your account to a student."<br><br>
	If you are linked to a student account but the tournamnent results aren't linked to your student record, locate the "Entries" box in the right-hand toolbar.  Click the link that says "link account to entries."<br><br>
