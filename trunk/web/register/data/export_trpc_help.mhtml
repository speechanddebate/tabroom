		<h2>Notes on exporting to TRPC</h2>

		<p> To export debate events, you must first set up the TRPC program
		with events and get the division numbers (1 - 4) for each debate
		division.  A single copy of TRPC only supports 4 divisions, so don't
		try to export more than that.  If you want to have different divisions
		on different TRPC computers, you must go through this step multiple
		times.</p>

		<p>The system will then download an export file, TRPC-Import.txt.  You
		can upload this into TRPC using the "Joy of Tournaments upload system",
		under the Format menu on TRPC.</p>

		<p> Please note that if you load more than one division into a
		computer, the divisions will be uploaded by TRPC, but they will not be
		marked active.  Go to Format:Tournament Setup Options:Tournament Name
		and set the correct number of divisions, and your 'missing' 2nd-4th
		divisions will appear.  </p>

		<p>Two teammates with the same code will be adjusted to be separate
		codes, though the second one will appear as "Regis XX", so you might
		want to search for XX and make it something more obvious.</p>

		<p>You have to also designate which judge groups you wish to export out
		of the database for this export.  Judges will be automatically slotted
		into divisions, and will be blocked against any divisions that
		tabroom.com doesn't think they should judge.  However, if you pick a
		judge group that does not contain any of the events you're exporting,
		you shall end up with a bunch of useless judges in TRPC.  Have fun with
		that, if that's the way you roll.</p>

		<h4>New:  Mutual Judge Preferencing</h4>

		<p>Tabroom now supports MJP (or MPJ, depending on your handedness)
		export into TRPC.  If a division supports MJP, a link to download the
		preference sheets appears to the right of the judge group.  Download
		this file, and upload it into TRPC using the Entry -> Enter Judge
		Preference Sheets menu, and click on the Upload Joy of Tournaments (the
		strange, aquamarine button towards the bottom right corner, floating on
		the odd, urine-colored box) and upload the TRPC-MJP.txt file.</p>
