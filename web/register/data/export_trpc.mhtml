			Notes on exporting to TRPC
		</h4>

		<p>
			To export debate events, you must first set up the TRPC program
			with events and get the division numbers (1 - 4) for each debate
			division.  A single copy of TRPC only supports 4 divisions, so
			don't try to export more than that.  If you want to have different
			divisions on different TRPC computers, you must go through this
			step multiple times.
		</p>

		<p>
			The system will then download an export file, TRPC-Import.txt.  You
			can upload this into TRPC using the "Joy of Tournaments upload
			system", under the Format menu on TRPC.  Yes, we appreciate the
			irony.
		</p>

		<p>
			Please note that if you load more than one division into a
			computer, the divisions will be uploaded by TRPC, but they will not
			be marked active.  Go to Format:Tournament Setup Options:Tournament
			Name and set the correct number of divisions, and your 'missing'
			2nd-4th divisions will appear.
		</p>

		<p>
			Two teammates with the same code will be adjusted to be separate
			codes, though the second one will appear as "Regis XX", so you
			might want to search for XX and make it something more obvious.
		</p>

		<p>
			You have to also designate which judge categories you wish to
			export out of the database for this export.  Judges will be
			automatically slotted into divisions, and will be blocked against
			any divisions that tabroom.com doesn't think they should judge.
			However, if you pick a judge category that does not contain any of
			the events you're exporting, you shall end up with a bunch of
			useless judges in TRPC.  Have fun with that, if that's the way you
			roll.
		</p>

		<h4>Mutual Judge Preferences</h4>

		<p>
			Tabroom supports MJP (or MPJ, depending on your handedness) export
			into TRPC.  If a division supports MJP, a link to download the
			preference sheets appears to the right of the judge category.
			Download this file, and upload it into TRPC using the Entry &rarr;
			Enter Judge Preference Sheets menu, and click on the Upload Joy of
			Tournaments (the strange, aquamarine button towards the bottom
			right corner, floating on the odd, urine-colored box) and upload
			the TRPC-MJP.txt file.
		</p>
