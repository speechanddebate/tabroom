				No, you cannot get them back.  No, it doesn't matter if you
				didn't mean it.  Computers have no mercy in such matters.  
				
				We do keep backups of the whole database but restoring a single
				tournament can take hours or days and we don't have that type
				of spare time.

					So, please, I beg of you. Take a backup before you do this

				Deleting the data here to run the following year's tournament
