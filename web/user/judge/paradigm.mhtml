		<p>
			Please bear in mind that paradigms are
			<span class="semibold redtext inline nospace">
				public, geared to an educational audience, and have your name attached.

			For more on how to write a helpful paradigm, consult

		<p>
			Discriminatory, hateful, harmful and/or profane language is
			forbidden, and its use will result in your paradigm being removed.
			We might also lock or delete your Tabroom account. In other words,
			be mature educators, and good people.
