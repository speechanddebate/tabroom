	If this is OK, you don't need to do anything.  If this is not OK,
	you may reply to this email to rant at the person who did it to find
	out why.\n\n

	Please note that the expectation is that you'd pre-arrange pay rates
	and arrangements with a hired judge, so if you just hired them willy
	nilly without doing so, chances are they cancelled this hire just as
	willy and every bit as nilly.\n\n
