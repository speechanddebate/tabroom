			The tournament <% $school->tourn->name %> requires all judges in <% $category->name %>
			to use online ballots
		</p>

		<p>

			Before registering judges in <% $category->name %>, judges must
			have Tabroom logins and their logins must be linked to their
			judging record on your roster.  To check which judges are already
			linked, check your judging roster by clicking Judges from your
			school screen when you first log in.  You can return to your school
			screen by tapping your email address in the top right corner.
		</p>

		<p>
			If this judge already has a Tabroom login of their own, enter their
			email address to link them.  If they do not, they must go to
			Tabroom.com, click Sign Up and create a login before they may be
			registered.
		</p>
