		<strong>INSTRUCTIONS:</strong>
		
			<p>The best way to get your Tournaman results to tabroom is via the <a href="https://www.tabroom.com//jbruschke/CATDownloads/UniversalDataStructure.rtf">Universal Data Structure</a>, which can be accomplished in 3 steps.  First, download the <a href="https://www.tabroom.com/jbruschke/CATDownloads/CAT20.exe">CAT</a> (see the full CAT page from the top ribbon on the Tabroom.com homepage).  Second, run the CAT, click the "Utilities" button in the bottom-right, and then the "Import Tournaman" button in the top-right.  In your documents folder there is now a directory called CAT which stores a file called TourneyData.xml.  Third, go to the tournament <a href="/request.mhtml">creation page</a> and use the section titled "upload a tournament from an idebate XML File," and upload the TourneyData.xml file.  When it uploads, you're done, and you do NOT need to upload any information through this page.</p>
			
			<p>If that process fails, you can .zip the Tournaman folder and email it to jbruschke@gmail.com</p>
			
			<p>An alternative is to upload the results directly from the tournaman folder using this page; doing so will upload the final places and speaker awards, but will not include any round-by-round information.  To do so, complete the steps below in order. The step you need to complete next will appear in bold.</p>
