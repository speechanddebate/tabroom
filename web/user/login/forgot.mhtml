			<h5>Some things to remember...</h5>

			<p class="bigger">
				Your tabroom.com login is tied to the email address you used
				when you first created it.  If you have changed your email
				address, try logging in with the old email.
			</p>

			<p class="bigger">
				You can change your email address or password within
				tabroom.com by clicking on "Account" in the top right
				corner of the screen after you log in.
			</p>

			<p class="bigger">
				Your password is case sensitive; be sure if you capitalized
				anything when you created it, you must do so to log in with it.
				However, emails are not case sensitive; upper and lower case do
				not matter.
			</p>

			<p class="bigger">
				Cookies must be enabled on your browser for tabroom.com to work.

			<p class="bigger">
				If you cannot remember your password, or no longer have access
				to your original email to get a reminder, or do not remember
				your email address, please email us at <% $Tab::admin_email %>.
