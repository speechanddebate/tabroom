		<h2>Link to the NSDA</h2>

			Login below with your NSDA Points Application username and

			with your National Speech &amp; Debate Assocation login.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Only do this with YOUR login</strong>, not your teammate,
			co-coach's, or anyone else's.  Doing so will screw up your online
			ballots, team management, and many other things.  We will undo it,
			and make fun of you a lot for it.  To ensure you have read this 
			paragraph and haven't just skipped the instructions, you must type
			"I am this person and no other" in the confirmation box below.

		<p>
			That phrase has a nice medieval flair, I think.

		<h4>How it works</h4>

		<p>
			Once you have linked your roster, points will be posted for each
			future tournament on Tabroom.  They are usually posted early in the
			week, on Monday or Tuesdays.  To confirm your points, log into the
			NSDA points system (<a
			href="http://points.speechanddebate.org">http://points.speechanddebate.org</a>
			and click the Auto-Post button that will appear above your coaches'
			names.  Confirm the points there, and designate coaches, and your
			points will auto-post.
		</p>

		<p>
			Points from tournaments that happened before you link your school
			records to the NSDA will not be retroactively posted.
		</p>
