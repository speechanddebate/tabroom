			Thank you!  Your district tournament has been created and registered with the
			NSDA office. 
		</p>

		<h5>
			If you're running on Tabroom
		</h5>

		<p class="bigger">
			There may be additional configuration you want to do.  Each judge
			category has been set up to separate judges in Speech, Congress and
			Debate with default obligations, but you may want to change some of
			that configuration.  Each weekend will have a separate judge group
			for each event type offered on that weekend.  So if you have Debate
			events on two separate weekends you will have a Debate judge
			category for each weekend.
		</p>
			
		<p class="bigger">
			You may also need to change the defaults for double entry policies.
			You can do all that in the usual places, under the Settings menu
			when you go into the tournament.  
		</p>

		<p class="bigger">
			Remember also the question mark icon on the top right of every
			screen leads you to the Help manual for Tabroom.
		</p>

		<h5 class="martopmore">
			If you're running on JOT
		</h5>

		<p class="bigger">
			Notification has already been sent to the folks at Joy of Tournaments
			with your information to get you set up.  You'll only need to access
			your tournament on Tabroom for three things:

			<ol class="bigger">
				<li>
					<span class="inline semibold">If your tournament dates change,</span>
					please go into your Tabroom District tournament, and change
					them under Settings - Tournament - Dates and Deadlines.
					You will also have to make this change on JOT's website. 
				</li>

				<li>

					<span class="inline semibold">If you change your mind and need to order plaques
					or ballots,</span> you can either email the office or
					indicate your order under Settings - Tournament - NSDA

				</li>

				<li>
					<span class="inline semibold">Once each tournament is done</span>, you should
					upload your JOT data file into Tabroom under Settings -
					Tournament - NSDA.  Once all your district tournaments are
					uploaded there, your qualifying entries will be ready to be
					registered for Nationals.

				</li>

			</ol>
