You are about to permanently delete the concession item <% $concession->name %>,
together with all the orders for it.

<p>This cannot be undone.  You can only get it back by re-entering it again.
That includes all the judge item assignments and round assignments.  They will
be gone, baby, gone.  </p>

<p>Don't come crying to me, and don't say I didn't warn you.</p>
<p>Because I did.  Right now</p>
