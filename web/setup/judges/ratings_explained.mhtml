		<h2>
			Setting up a pref sheet: things to know
		</h2>

		<h4>Ordinals</h4>

		<p>

			Ordinal pref sheets are used most often in the US college policy
			community.  The user inputs a rank ordering of every judge in the
			jpool.  The judges are then weighted according to percentiles based
			on their rounds of committment, so that all prefs are on a 100
			point scale.  A judge who is in for 8 rounds at the top of one
			entry's pref sheet will be equal in percentage terms to 4 judges
			each in for 2 rounds at the top of another's pref sheet.
		</p>

		<p>
			Ordinal percentile tolerances depend on the size of your judging
			jpool.  In larger tournaments with 100+ judges the expectation is to
			place no judges above 50 percentile, and try to keep the range
			below 25 point spreads.  Smaller judge jpools will mean larger
			spreads between individual judges and thus will have to adjust
			accordingly.
		</p>

		<h4>Tiers</h4>

		<p>
			Tiered preference systems are those when an entry rates a quota of
			judges in a number of tiers.  Traditionally tiers have been limited
			to 6 tiers or sometimes 9, as that is what TRPC supports.  If you are
			using Tabroom to register for a TRPC tabbed tournament you must use
			either 6 or 9 tiers only, and you must use 6 tiers for a double
			flighted event.  If you are tabbing directly on Tabroom itself you may
			use however many tiers you wish.
		</p>

		<p>
			Tiers on Tabroom work with percentages, not fixed numbers of judges
			or rounds, in order to not penalize schools who bring a lot of
			judges to your tournament.  Conflicts and a school's own judges are
			not counted as part of the jpool of judges who must be rated, and
			the judge burdens for each tier are calculated as a percentage of
			the remaining jpool of judging.  Because of rounding, percentages
			don't always add up precisely, so be sure the "overflow" is where
			you want it so as not to stiff a category.
		</p>

		<p>
			There are two styles of pref sheets available, bottom-up and top-down
			pref sheets.  Top-down pref sheets are traditional, though conceptually
			I happen to prefer bottom-up pref sheets.
		</p>

		<h4>Maximums, or bottom-up prefs</h4>

		<P>
			Use a maximum value for each tier except for 1, and make 1 the
			remainder to have a bottom-up pref sheet.  The best way to think of
			such a sheet is as a graduated strike sheet; you get a certain
			number of strikes, a certain number of 5s, a certain number of 4s,
			etc -- and all the rest of the judges are 1s.  So instead of
			minimums, which are sometimes hard to calculate cleanly once
			conflicts are removed from a school's jpool, you end up with limited
			strikes, limited 5s, limited 4s, etc.   Leave 1 blank or set it to
			100%; you do not want to limit 1s, nor should you also set a
			minimum number of 1s, since that'll just confuse the users and the
			rounding math won't work out evenly in many cases.
		</p>

		<p>
			The best way to fill out such a sheet is to start with strikes, and
			then work upwards, rating your least favorite judges at each tier
			until it is full until you finish.
		</p>

		<h4>Minimums, or top-down prefs</h4>

		<p>
			Top-down prefs are the type of prefs you might be used to from JOT.
			Each tier has a minimum percentage of judging you must fill in; then
			a "leftovers" category is usually set at the 2nd to worst tier with neither
			minimum nor maximum.
		</p>

		<p>
			One of the downsides of this type of pref sheet is that the user gets
			penalized for having a lot of conflicts in unpredictable ways; sometimes
			some tiers will be large due to rounding errors and you'll have to require
			more 1s and 2s from some schools instead of others.  The other downside
			is that because tabroom does not have "draft" pref sheets but allows half
			saving all the time, it cannot reject an "incomplete" pref sheet.  It does
			warn the user when a sheet is out of compliance but allows the user to
			save them all the same, thus creating potential for shenanigans.  Usually
			that's not a huge deal, but it's there.
