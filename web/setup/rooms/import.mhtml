			I'm going to level with you: computers are really stupid.  It takes
			a lot of effort to make them pretend to be smart.
		</p>

		<p>
			Therefore, the file you upload must be formatted precisely.  All
			files must be in raw ASCII text.  If you save an Excel sheet into
			CSV format, that will work!  However a normal Excel sheet (.xls,
			.xlsx) will not.  A word doc list or PDF or anything likewise
			cannot work.
		</p>

		<p>
			The fields must be in the proper order.  Do not put single or
			double quotes or commas into the text fields either: all kinds of
			bad will happen if you do.

				For an online site, the rooms file must be in the format:
				<div class="centeralign">
					<pre>Name, Entry URL, Entry Password, Judge URL, Judge Password, CC API ID</pre>
				</div>
			</p>

%		} else {

			<p>
				For an in-person site, the rooms file must be in the format:

				<div class="centeralign">
				<pre>Name, Quality, Capacity, Notes, Acccessible, Map URL</pre>
				</div>
			</p>

%		}

		<p>
			One room per line.  Only the room name is required; you can leave
			all other fields blank and the room will still import.  Leave
			fields blank but mark them with commas if you want to use later
			ones; so if you want to include notes but not bother with quality
			or capacity numbers, do this:

			<pre class="centeralign">Room 214,,,Extemp Room Only,</pre>
		</p>

		<p>
			Ratings for quality and capacity must be numerical.  Lower numbers
			mean "better" quality and will be used first; "capacity" is solely
			for your information and is not automatically used by Tabroom.
