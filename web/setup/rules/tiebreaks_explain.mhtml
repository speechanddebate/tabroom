					Create a tiebreak set for each type of advancement you wish to

					Elims, one for IE Prelims, one for IE Elims, and one for Debate

		<h2>Everything you ever wanted to know about tiebreakers, but were afraid to ask</h2> 

		<h4>Entering tiebreakers:</h4>

		<p>You should set up sets of tiebreakers as they apply to an event or
		set of events in your tournament.  Tiebreakers work on tiers; a tier is
		calculated with all the tiebreakers in that tier and added together.
		You can also multiply a given tiebreaker with in a tier to weight it
		heavier.  So if you want your speech tournament final rankings to count
		the ranks in the final round twice, with the ranks in the other elim
		rounds once, you would set up a tier with ranks for finals with a
		multiplier of 2, and then put a tiebreaker of ranks for elim rounds
		with a multiplier of 1 into the same tier. </p>

		<p>Please do not mix tiebreakers that sort in opposite directions in
		the same tier; in other words, lower ranks are better, while higher
		points are better; adding the two together on the same tier will
		generate nonsense results.</p>

		<p>You can set a given tiebreaker to drop the best, worst, or high/low
		values of a given rank.  Next to Drop fill in the type of drop, and in
		the number box, enter how many values deep you want to go (so to drop
		the 2 worst and 2 best speaker points, you'd put 2 in the input box and
		select High/Low in the drop-down)</p>

						This determines the competitor's ranking within their

						score ranking; a person who won their quarterfinal overall
						would be given a single rank of 1 for the quarters.

						So if you wanted the final ranking of an entry to count

						ranking of how an entry did in their previous elim
						rounds, you should use this tiebreaker.

						If instead you want to advance equal numbers of competitors
						from each section, you should instead select the option to
						do so at the top of the tiebreaker screen.
