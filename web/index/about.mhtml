			<h4>Need help?</h4>

			<p>If you're a student, coach, or parent and have a question about a 
			particular tournament, <strong>email them directly</strong> - they're more likely
			to be able to help you. Contact information can usually be found in the 
			tournament invitation.</p>
			
			<p>If you're having trouble using the Tabroom software itself, email:</p>

			<a href="mailto:help@tabroom.com" class="yellow full">
				help@tabroom.com
			</a>

			<p class="strong">Emailing help is the best way to get quick 
			help with using Tabroom. </p>
			
			<p>Multiple people watch the helpline, especially during
			weekends in season.  Please do not email individual people on the
			project directly or call the NSDA office; that will only delay 
			word getting to the folks who can help you.</p>
	
			<p>For new feature requests or ideas, email:</p>

			<a href="mailto:help@tabroom.com" class="yellow full">
				help@tabroom.com
			</a>

			<p>
				To run a tournament on Tabroom, log in and hit "Request a
				tournament" on the right hand toolbar.  The how-to guide is
				available from the question mark icon on the top right corner.
				No approval, pre-notification or cost is required to register
				or tabulate a tournament on Tabroom.
