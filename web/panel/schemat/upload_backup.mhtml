				Since you find yourself in a position to be restoring a round from

				and you'll actually read this cautionary note.

			<p
				title="Don't be like Danny DeBois in this or anything else"
			>
				Please, only use this to upload Tabroom.com data that you've
				downloaded from a round from THIS tournament.  This backup only
				works inside the SAME tournament and will not go through and
				un-delete competitors, judges or schools, or sync the same
				from another tournament.

				If you try to upload a full tournament backup or a CSV file or
				a copy of your 8th grade report card or whatever else, it will not
				work and might delete other data.  And if you ask me to help after
				doing that I will laugh at you so very very much.

			<p
				title="So if you accidentally delete the entire friggin Glenbrooks like Brian did, you're still SOL"

				But if you're here, you probably don't read things anyway, since
				that's why you ended up deleting a round.  Or you're in APDA, which
				amounts to the same thing.   So you're probably even more hosed
				than you were five minutes ago.  But don't say I didn't warn you.
